<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This volume is a reprint of newspaper reports
of a series of lectures delivered by the author from
the pulpit of Congregation B'nai Jehudah, Kansas
City, Mo., during the Fall and Winter of
1885-1886.</p>

<p>The lectures were prepared to fulfill the requirements
of popular discourses, and designed to
convey information upon a highly important epoch
of the world's history, that is almost neglected
in English literature.</p>

<p>The thought of publishing these lectures in
book form was utterly foreign to the author throughout
their preparation, until an urgent solicitation
from very many persons, both Jews and Gentiles,
in all parts of this country, whose interest in
these lectures was aroused by their wide-spread
republication by the Press, made it a duty.</p>


<p class="i2"><i>Kansas City, Mo., January, 1887.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The following are two of the many letters addressed
to the author, requesting him to have his
lectures on "<span class="smcap">The Jews and Moors in Spain</span>" published
in book form.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Letter from Hon. T. T. Crittenden</span>,</h3>
<p class="center">Ex-Governor of the State of Missouri.</p>

<p class="right smcap">Kansas City, Mo., March 29, 1886.</p>

<p class="p2 smcap">Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;Having read with pleasure and edification
the series of lectures delivered in the Synagogue, Kansas
City, Mo., entitled "<span class="smcap">The Jews and Moors in Spain</span>," in which
you treat of the social, political, religious and intellectual life
of these Oriental nations, may I inquire if it is your purpose
to have them published in book form?</p>

<p>I think the lectures too valuable, too full of prolonged
historic research and thought to live only one day in the
columns of a daily newspaper. Even if they were designed
"to adorn a tale or point a moral" of the great race to
which you belong, whose history commenced with Abraham
and will end with that of the human race, still the history
of that race was (and is) so intimately interlaced with the
history of the other races for the intervening centuries, that
the lectures are in part, so much the history of the other
races, that they can be read and studied by all men without
prejudice or animosity. One thing is certain, you have in
the lectures divested history of much of its dry and useless
details, and make it a thrilling romance of facts, presented
in the simplest and purest Anglo-Saxon language.</p>

<p>I know not how others view the lectures, only speak this
for myself&mdash;no library is complete without the History of
the Jewish race, and no history of that race for the period
covered, is more comprehensive, truthful and impartial than
that presented in these lectures. I think the book would
find a ready sale in all thinking, reading communities.</p>

<p class="p2 iright">Very Truly Yours,</p>

<p class="smcap right">Thos. T. Crittenden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a></span></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Letter From Arnold Krekel</span>,</h3>

<p class="center">Judge of the U. S. Court, Western District of Missouri.</p>

<p class="smcap right">Kansas City, Mo, April 2, 1886.</p>

<p class="p2 smcap">Rabbi Joseph Krauskopf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;Having attended a number of your lectures
on "<span class="smcap">The History of the Jews and Moors in Spain</span>,"
and read such as I did not hear, allow me to give expression
to my views regarding the same. Aside from the interest
the student of history must always feel in that part of history
of which your lectures treat, the manner of treatment
specially interested me. Relating historical facts, too often
becomes dry and irksome, and it requires more than ordinary
skill of presentation to make the subject interesting and
attractive. In this you have fully succeeded by interweaving
with the facts those matters which enliven the picture.
A knowledge of the social condition of a people, and the
relation to which they stand to their age, enables us to
judge of their worth and the influence they exercised. Your
lectures, as a whole, presented a life-breathing social picture
of the times and people, and as the civilization of Europe
was largely effected by the Jews and Moors, their history
embraces to a large extent the history of civilization, and
thereby acquires an interest not limited to the people and
countries of which your lectures give so interesting an account.
A publication in permanent form of your lectures
would advance our knowledge of that part of history to
which we have always looked for instruction and guidance,
and I hope you may find a way of accomplishing this object.</p>

<p class="p2 iright">Very Respectfully,</p>

<p class="smcap right">A. Krekel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a></span></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Editorial in the Kansas City Journal of Sunday,
April 24, 1886.</span></h3>

<p>The Journal published yesterday morning the eighteenth
and last of the series of lectures delivered by Rabbi Krauskopf
on "<span class="smcap">The Jew and Moor in Spain</span>." From first to last
these lectures have been of absorbing interest. The Synagogue
has been crowded on the occasion of their delivery,
and it was with regret that the Rabbi's hearers heard that
the lecture on Friday night was the last of the series.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of Rabbi Krauskopf to have his
lectures issued in book form. They will make an attractive
volume, and will no doubt be widely read. Rabbi Krauskopf
is a graphic writer, and his lectures upon "<span class="smcap">The Jew And
Moor in Spain</span>" are a series of historical occurrences related
in a manner that serves to chain the reader's attention&mdash;old
world scenes are accurately and vividly described.
The reader is taken through all the struggles,
the defeats and the triumphs of the Jews. Their arts, their
industry, their upright dealings and their steadfast adherence
to their religion through trials and persecutions are related
with a proud belief that they were God's chosen people,
working out their destiny according to His will. The
lecturer started with the Jews as he found them, a prosperous
community in southwestern Europe, busily engaged in transforming
Spain into a granery and garden spot of Europe,
respected by their heathen neighbors, happy and contented.
He passed on to the period of persecution in the Sixth
Century when Christianity of a somewhat forcible nature
attempted the conversion of the Jews by persecution; when
many were massacred and others driven into exile. Then
came the Arab invasion and during the period of Moham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>medan
supremacy the Jews were again allowed to live in
peace and the exercise of their own religious rites. For
eight centuries the Jews and the Moors worked side by side
and the once down-trodden people rose to affluence and
high position.</p>

<p>With the decline of Mohammedan power, and the expulsion
of the Moors by the Spaniards, the Jews were again
reduced to a pitiable state. Spain arose to enormous
power, but that, too, has waned, and the population of
30,000,000 people has dwindled to about half that number.
The manufactures, the commerce and the agricultural,
the universal prosperity which the Jews had built up disappeared,
and the glory of Spain departed as rapidly as it had
been acquired. In the expulsion of the Jews and Moors
alone does Rabbi Krauskopf attribute the ruin of Spain.</p>

<p>The lectures read like a romance. They are an historical
romance, told in a charming manner, full of descriptions
accurate, truthful. When they are compiled the volume
will undoubtedly meet with a large sale. It was not the
original intention of the Rabbi to issue his lectures in book
form, but many people, both Jews and Christians, have
requested him verbally and by letter to do so, and he has
decided to grant their requests.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
A DAY IN CORDOVA.</h2>

<p>SIX AND EIGHT AND TEN CENTURIES BACK IN THE WORLD'S HISTORY.&mdash;OUR
ENTRANCE INTO SPAIN.&mdash;A MIRACLE.&mdash;THE BEAUTIFUL
GUADALQUIVIR.&mdash;OUR BRONZE COMPLEXIONED OARSMAN.&mdash;FAIR
CORDOVA.&mdash;THE CITY OF THE
ARTS AND SCIENCES.&mdash;NIGHT.&mdash;A SERENADE.&mdash;OUR
DEPARTURE.</p>


<p class="p2">It is with the past that we shall commune in
these pages. Events and scenes, beautiful and
loathsome, joyous and tearful, ennobling and
degrading, will follow each other in rapid succession.
There will be much that, despite the
very best of historic sources, and most reliable
and impartial authorities, will be accepted as fabulous
or will be rejected as incredible or impossible.
Achievements will be described, that will startle
us for their peerless magnificence and lead us to
suppose that we are not dealing with facts, but
with the imaginations of some rich phantasy or
with the fictitious colorings of a mind enthusiastic
for an ideal society; and miseries and sufferings
will be depicted that will strike terror into our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
very soul, and cause our heart to rise in rebellion
against the mind, when asked to believe them as
actual occurrences, and not as some distressing
and revolting and blood-stained work of fiction,
written by some hellish fiend for the amusement
or for the schooling of the vicious indwellers of
the bottomless pit of Tophet. And yet, it will
be history, and true history, strange and incredible,
marvelous and anomalous though it may
appear. Six and eight and ten centuries have
since passed by, and the most wonderful of all centuries
they have been, centuries that chronicle the
birth and prodigious growth of the sciences and
inventions, the creation and successful continuance
of republican and constitutional governments,
the breaking down of castes and barriers
between man and man, the suppression of political
and religious terrorism and these blessed results
have so tickled our conceit, have so raised
our moral standard that it is almost impossible
for us to properly conceive&mdash;either in all its
grandeur or in all its baseness&mdash;that era of the
past, which we are about to traverse.</p>

<p>But know we must, and therefore, what the
mind refuses to believe, and what the heart refuses
to credit, let the eye see. Let us think
ourselves back six and eight and ten centuries.
Let us enter upon a far and distant journey.
Away we speed. Far, far across the wild Atlantic.
We have reached the sunny land of Spain.
Here let us pause for a hasty inspection. It will
not take us long, for that country, that is among
the poorest of all European countries to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
whose reeking filth has recently made it a scene
of revelry to the ravishing plague, whose stupendous
ignorance, and appalling superstitions,
have made it a by-word among the civilized people
of the earth, that country, so backward now,
will certainly have no attractiveness for us, ten
centuries earlier in its history.</p>

<p>Lo! A miracle! The magic wand of some frolicksome
fay must have suddenly transformed the
land of expected filth and wretchedness into a
beauteous fairyland. Amidst rapturous admiration
of the indescribable beauties, which meet our
gaze everywhere, we glide along upon the placid
surface of the Guadalquivir, in which a wondrously
clear blue sky glasses itself, and splendrous
palaces and gorgeous parks are reflected. We
have entered beautiful Andalusia. We glide
along the southern declivity of the Sierra Morena.
Suddenly there breaks upon our view a
scene of beauty that mocks every attempt at description.
We ask our black eyed, bronze complexioned
and proud featured oarsman for the
name of that magnificent city that lies stretched
for miles along the right bank. He understands
us not. We address him in French, in German,
in Greek, in Latin. No answer. We are at
our wits' end. We must know, and so we seek
recourse, as a last resort, to our mother tongue,
the language of the Hebrews, and his face brightens,
and his tongue is loosened, and in accents
as melodious and pure as it must have been spoken
by David himself, when he sang to his harp,
the words of his own heaven-inspired psalms he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
makes reply: "What ye behold, ye strangers,
is the city of Cordova, the government seat of
the valiant and chivalrous, and scholarly and
liberal, and art-loving Caliph Abderrahman III."</p>

<p>We are burning with a desire to see that
city, whose simple outlines display such bewildering
elegance. With our courteous oarsman as
guide, we advance along the street that leads
from the river bank. We gaze and gaze in awe-stricken
silence. Amazement is expressed on
every countenance. Our eyes are dazzled with the
enchanting magnificence that abounds. We have
reached the palace of the Caliph. Are we dreaming?
Are we under the power of some magic spell?
Is this a whim of some sportive, mischief-loving
fay? Have we not thought ourselves some ten
centuries back? Are we in the midst of the
Dark Ages; in European lands, and among the
people of the tenth century, concerning whose
stupendous ignorance and loathsome filth historians
have had so much to say? Has history
deceived us in its teaching that the people of
Europe, six and eight centuries back had scarcely
emerged from the savage state, that they inhabited
floorless, chimneyless, windowless huts,
those of princes and monarchs differing only in
their having rushes on the floor and straw mats
against the walls, that they fed on roots and
vetches and bark of trees, clothed in garments of
untanned skin which remained on the body till
they dropped in pieces, that there existed scarcely
a city, everywhere pathless forest and howling
wastes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not a dream. Neither has history deceived
us. We are in European lands, but among
Oriental people. We are in the midst of the
prime of the dark ages, but we are in the Southern
part of Spain, in Andalusia, in the city of
Cordova, a city of 200,000 houses, and 1,000,000
inhabitants, of hundreds of parks and public gardens,
of menageries of foreign animals, of aviaries
of rare birds, of factories in which skilled
workmen display their art in textures of silk,
cotton, linen, and all the miracles of the loom,
in jewelry and in filigree works, in works of art,
and in scientific instruments and apparatus. We
are in the city that, even then, could boast of a
college of music, of libraries, of public schools, of
universities in which instructions were given in
the sciences and philosophies and languages, and
literatures and arts. We are in the city of art
and culture and learning, the city made famous
and beautiful by the literary and cultured Moors
and Jews, whose prosperity continued as long as
the followers of Mohammed and the followers of
Moses were permitted to dwell in peace side by
side, but whose glory vanished as soon as Christianity
banished the Jews and Moors from Spain.
But we must not indulge in any reflections now.
Our raven locked guide, whose beautiful form,
and winning countenance, and melodious voice
involuntarily remind us of the beautiful lover of
the love-inflamed Shulamite in "Solomon's
Song," beckons, and we must follow. On we
march, and with every step new and matchless
beauties unroll themselves before us. We know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
not what we shall admire first, and most, whether
the polished marble balconies that overhang
luscious orange gardens, or the courts with the
cascades of water beneath the shades of the cypress
trees, or the artificial lakes, supplied with
water by hydraulic works, replete with fish;
whether the shady retreats with inlaid floors and
walls of exquisite mosaic, vaulted with stained
glass and speckled with gold, over which streams
of water are continually gushing, or the fountains
of quicksilver, that shoot up in glittering globules
and fall with a tranquil sound like fairy
bells; whether the apartments into which cool
air is drawn from the flower gardens, in summer
by means of ventilating towers and in winter
through earthen pipes or caleducts imbedded in
the walls&mdash;the hypocaust, in the vaults below, or
the walls adorned with arabesque and paintings
of agricultural scenes and views of paradise, or
the ceilings corniced with fretted gold, other
great chandeliers with their hundreds and hundreds
of lamps; whether the columns of Greek,
Italian, Spanish and African marble, covered with
verd-antique and incrusted with lapis lazuli, or
the furniture of sandal and citron wood, inlaid
with mother of pearl, ivory, silver, or relieved
with gold and precious malachite, or
the costume of the ladies woven in silk and
gold, and decorated with gems of chrysolites,
hyacinths, emeralds and sapphires; whether
the vases of rock crystal, Chinese porcelains,
the embroidered Persian carpets with which the
floors are covered, the rich tapestry that hang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>s
along the walls, or the beautiful gardens, profuse
with rare and exotic flowers, winding walks,
bowers of roses, seats cut out of the rock, crypt-like
grottoes hewn into the stone; whether the
baths of marble, with hot and cold water, carried
thither by pipes of metal, or the niches, with their
dripping alcarazzas, or the whispering galleries
for the amusement of the women, or the labyrinths
and marble play-courts for the children.</p>

<p>On and on we pass, and new beauties still.
We pass mosques and synagogues whose architectural
finish is still the admiration and model
of the world, and our gentle guide informs us
that a public school is attached to each, in which
the children of the poor are taught to read and
write. We pass academies and universities, and
our guide assures us that many a Hebrew presides
over the Moorish institutions of learning.
He reads the expression of surprise on our countenance,
for we think of the striking contrast
between his Mohammedan liberality
and the intolerance of the other European
countries, from which they are scarcely weaned
as yet, and he modestly informs us that the Mohammedan
maxim is, that "the real learning of a
man is of more importance than any particular
religious opinions he may entertain." And as
the famous scholars pass in and out, our guide
mentions them by name, and speaks of their
brilliant accomplishments, of professors of Arabic
classical literature, of professors of mathematics
and astronomy, compilers of dictionaries similar to
those now in use, but of larger copiousness, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of these covering sixty volumes, he points out
the lexicographers of Greek and Latin and Hebrew
and Arabic, and the encyclopedists of the
"Historical Dictionary of Sciences," the poets of
the satires, odes and elegies, and the inventors
of the rhyme, the writers of history, of chronology,
of numismatics, mathematics, astronomy, of pulpit
oratory, of agriculture, of topography, of statistics,
of physics, philosophy, medicines, dentistry,
surgery, zoology, botany, pharmacy, and of the
numerous other branches of learning.</p>

<p>Night has set in. Men are gathering around
their evening fires to listen to the wandering literati,
who exercise their wonderful powers of
tale telling, and edify the eager listeners by such
narratives as those that have descended to us in
the "Arabian Nights' Entertainments." The
dulcet strains of the dreamy and love-awaking
mandolin, accompanying the rapturous love song
of some chivalrous knight to his lady fair, break
on our ears. Soon all is silent. We fain would
stay, but our guide is weary from his day's task.
Perchance the sweet strains of the serenade have
awakened within his bosom tender longings for
his fair Shulamite, "whose eyes are as the dove's,
and whose lips are like a thread of scarlet, and
whose speech is comely," (Song of Solomon,
chap. iv.) to whom he would eagerly speed.
And so we retrace our steps. For miles we
walk in a straight line, by the light of public
lamps; seven hundred years after this time
there was not so much as one public lamp in
London.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
For miles we walk along solidly paved streets.
In Paris centuries subsequently, whoever stepped
over his threshold on a rainy day stepped up to
his ankles in mud. We have reached the bank
of the Guadalquivir, and we have parted with our
guide.</p>

<p>We have seen in one day more than we
ever dared to dream of; enough to tempt us to
visit it again and again, and not only Cordova,
but also Grenada, Toledo, Barcelona, Saragossa,
Seville, and other cities, to acquire a better acquaintanceship
with their scholars and institutions,
and with the wondrous advance of their civilization.
Before we return, however, we shall visit
France, Germany, England and Northern Spain,
during the same era of the world's history, about
ten centuries back, and the scenes that we shall
meet there will enable us to appreciate all the
better the benefits which the Moors and the Jews
lavished upon Europe, and we shall become the
more painfully conscious of the unatonable crime
Spain has committed in expelling the Moors from
Europe, and degrading the Jews for centuries to
the dregs of mankind.</p>

<p class="p2">On, on, we glide upon the smooth, broad bosom
of the majestic Guadalquivir, along graceful
groves and parks and palaces, through woods
and meads, hills and dales, shades and sun. A
last glance, and beauteous Cordova hides her
proud head behind the sun-kissed horizon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fair Cordova, fair Andalusia, fair Southern lands
of Spain, fare ye well, take our brief adieu, till
we visit you anew.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On, on, we sail, towards the Atlantic now we
speed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have reached the shores of the interminable
ocean. Its wild waves dash fiercely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
against the rock-ribbed shores, as if impatient
for our return. Our goodly ship, staunch and
strong, raises and lowers its festooned bow upon
the heaving billows of the waters vast, and its
pendant is playing in the wind, and its sails from
the foreroyal to the mizzenroyal, and up to the
very top of the mainroyal are furled to the full,
in its hearty welcome to our return. We embark,
and&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line">Four days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,</div>
<div class="line">New shores descried, make every bosom gay,"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>For we are to visit beautiful France, and learned
Germany, and busy England, and Italy, of classic
fame.</p>

<p>Once more we are on the continent. Once
more our observations are to be put to the task.
Once more we think ourselves some six and
eight and ten centuries back in the world's history.
Once more the eye is to be made to see
what the mind has refused to credit.</p>

<p>Dreary and chilling and appalling are the
scenes that now break upon our view. Longingly
we think of thee, fair Cordova, thou pride
of beauteous Andalusia. We think of thy pavements
of marble, of thy fountains of jasper, of
thy wondrous artistic skill, of thy exquisite gardens,
of thy famous poets and musicians, artists
and writers, philosophers and scientists, of thy
chivalrous knights and enchanting ladies. Longingly
we think of thy wondrous beauty, that would,
indeed, in our present surroundings, have sounded
fabulous had not our own eyes seen it. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
we been suddenly transplanted from the midst of
blossoming and ripening summer, joyous because
of its balmy breath and the melodious song of its
birds, and the fragrant breath of its flowers, and
the gladdening sight of its ripening fruit into the
midst of the barren winter, where nature is frozen
dead, and the storm rides on the gale, and the
earth is bare and naked, and the air is cold and
dreary, and the sun shines gloomily through the
bleak and murky skies, that sudden change could
not have been more keenly nor more painfully
felt than that which marked the contrast between
the southern lands of Spain and the countries of
France and Germany and England and Italy,
during the same age of the world's history.
Scarcely a city anywhere, save those few that
had been erected along the Rhine and the Danube
by the Romans. Nothing that could, even
with the broadest stretch of leniency, be designated
as agricultural. Everywhere pathless forests,
howling wastes, ill-boding wildernesses,
death-exhaling swamps, pestiferous fens. Prussia,
and many more of to-day's proudest stars
in the galaxy of European provinces, we find still
uncivilized, still roaming about in the very costumes
of native barbarians, in the spirits&mdash;and vampires&mdash;and
nixes&mdash;and gnomes&mdash;and kobolds&mdash;inhabited
pathless forests. Nowhere a street or
highway, save those the Romans had built.
Everywhere we must make our way, amidst indescribable
difficulties, through almost impassable
mud and clay. The people crowded together in
miserable hamlets, inhabit wretched homesteads,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
crudely and bunglingly put together of undressed
timber, or of twigs wattled together and covered
with clays or thatched with straw or reeds, consisting
seldom of more than one room, which
shelters alike man, woman, child, man servant,
maid servant, fowl and beast, a commingling of
sex and species not altogether conducive to modesty
or morality. The floor, for the main part is
composed of the hard bare ground, or at best is
covered with dry leaves or with filthy rushes.
Nowhere a window, nowhere a chimney, the
smoke of the ill-fed, cheerless fire escaping through
a hole in the roof. Straw pellets constitute the
bed, and a round log serves the place of bolster
and pillow, one platter of treen stands in the center
of the table&mdash;if "table" it might be called&mdash;from
which man, woman and child, master and
servant, maid and mistress, eat with spoons of
wood. Fingers serve the place of knives and
forks, and a wooden trencher makes the round
to quench the thirst.</p>

<p>Everywhere we meet with men with squalid
beards, and women with hair unkempt and matted
with filth, and both, clothed in garments of
untanned skin, or, at best, of leather or hair cloth,
that are not changed till they drop in pieces of
themselves, a loathsome mass of vermin, stench
and rags. No attempt at drainage; the putrefying
slops and garbage and rubbish are unceremoniously
thrown out of the door.</p>

<p>The most revolting uncleanness abounds, and
we cannot help thinking of the scrupulous cleanliness
that distinguished Cordova, for cleanness is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
one of the most rigorous injunctions and requirements
with both the religion of Mohammed and
the religion of Moses. Here, on the contrary,
personal uncleanliness, the renunciation of every
personal comfort, the branding of every effort for
better surroundings, we are told, upon inquiry,
has the highest sanction of the church. The sordid
example set by the Ascetic monks has established
the belief that cleanliness of the body leads
to the pollution of the soul, that in the past those
saints were most admired who had become one
hideous mass of clotted filth. With a thrill of
admiration a priest informs us that St. Jerome had
seen a monk who for thirty years had lived in a
hole, and who never washed his clothes, nor
changed his tunic till it fell to pieces; that St.
Ammon had never seen himself naked; that the
famous virgin, named Silvia, had resolutely refused
for sixty years, on religious principles, to wash
any part of her body, except her fingers; that
St. Euphraxia had joined a convent of 130 nuns,
who shuddered at the mention of a bath; that an
anchorite had once imagined that he was mocked
by an illusion of the devil, as he saw gliding before
him through the desert a naked creature
black with filth and years of exposure; it was the
once beautiful St. Mary of Egypt, who had thus
during forty-seven years been expiating her sins
of Asceticism.</p>

<p>We have seen enough to lead us to the conclusion,
that when we enter into an examination
of the mental and moral and religious state of
the people, whose personal and domestic life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
hold so low a rank in the history of civilization,
we must not place our expectations too high.
But low as we picture it to ourselves, the reality
we find is infinitly lower than even our most lenient
imagination had pictured it. Only a week
ago we found Cordova proud, and distinguished,
and peerless in the realm of culture, and art, and
philosophy, and science, and now, during the
same period of the world's history, we find a deep
black cloud of appalling ignorance overhanging
France, and Italy, and Germany and England,
here and there only broken by a few, a very few,
glimmering lights. Intellect, fettered hand and
foot, lies bleeding at the feet of benighted barbarism,
writhing in pain beneath the lashes of degrading
superstitions, and groveling credulity.
We search for the cause of this stupendous ignorance,
and we soon find that to the clergy, more
than to all other causes combined, belongs the
very ignoble distinction of having ushered into
Europe this stolid ignorance, and for being responsible
for the unatonable crime of having retarded
the advance of civilization by many centuries.</p>

<p>To the all powerful and all controlling influence
of the Church is to be ascribed
the universal paralysis of the mind during the
very same period, when art and science and independent
research flourished in Southern Spain
under Moorish and Jewish influence. Whomsoever
we approach, be they dignitaries of the
Church or Church menials, distinguished luminaries
or obscure parish priests, a conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
with them soon proves to us the sad truth, that
their stock of knowledge exhausts itself with an
enumeration of some monstrous legends or
with the practice and teaching of some degrading
and repulsive superstitions.</p>

<p>Secular knowledge is spurned. Physical
science is held in avowed contempt and persecuted
upon the ground of its inconsistency with
revealed truth. Philosophical research is prohibited,
under the severest punishment, as pernicious
to piety. Upon inquiry as to the cause of
this persecution of learning on the part of the church,
which, as we modestly dare to suggest, has nothing
to lose, but everything to gain from rational
research and diligent pursuit of knowledge, a
bishop emphatically informs us that they did this
with the sanction and authority of the fourth
council of Carthage, which had prohibited the
reading of secular books by bishops, and with the
authority of Jerome who had condemned the
study of secular subjects, except for pious ends,
and as there was no lack of piety (so they artlessly
thought) they saw little use in preserving the
learning and literature of the accursed Jews and
heathens, and fearing lest they fall into the hands
of others, not so pious as they, and not so protected
against their pernicious influence by the
knowledge of legends, or by the skillful use of
magic spells, or exorcising charms, as they were.
Or perhaps secretly fearing, lest an intimate
knowledge of the learning of the ancients might
open the eyes of the people to the ignorance and
extortions and crimes and corruptions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Church, they condemn that whole literature to
the flames. Hundreds and thousands of valuable
manuscripts are thus pitilessly destroyed. We
fain would stay their cruel hand, but we fear for
our lives. We see them erase the writing from
hundreds and thousands of parchment copies of
ancient priceless lore, and substitute in its stead
legends of saints, and ecclesiastical rubbish, occasioning
thus the loss of many an ancient author
that is now so painfully missed.</p>

<p>We turn away from this revolting stupidity, but
nowhere a pleasing sign to allay our anguish, or
appease our grief-stricken heart.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="line">"Oh, thou monstrous ignorance, how deformed dost thou look."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nowhere freedom of humane thought. Everyone
compelled to think as ecclesiastical authority
orders him to think. In Germany, France and
Northern Spain we find scarcely one priest out of
a thousand who can write his name. In Rome
itself, once the city of art and culture and learning,
as late as 992, a reliable authority informs us,
there is not a priest to be found who knows the
first elements of letters. In England, King Alfred
informs us that he cannot recollect a single priest
south of the Thames (then the most civilized part
of England) who at the time of his accession understood
or could translate the ordinary Latin
prayer, and that the homilies which they preached
were compiled for their use by some bishop from
former works of the same kind, or from the early
Patristic writings. Throughout Christendom we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
find no restraint on the ordination of persons absolutely
illiterate, no rules to exclude the ignorant
from ecclesiastical preferment, no inclination and
no power to make it obligatory upon even the
mitred dignitaries, to be able to read a line from
those Scriptures which they are to teach and
preach as the rule of right and the guide to moral
conduct. Darkness, intense darkness, stupendous
ignorance everywhere. We shudder as we
think of the cruelties which this ignorance will bequeath
as its curse upon mankind. We shudder
as we think of how this ignorance needs must
check the advance of civilization. We know
that knowledge will not be fettered forever, but
before it shall be able to assert its right to sway
over the mind of men, countless giant minds will
have to be crushed and indescribable suffering
will have to be endured. We know
that "ignorance seldom vaults into knowledge,
but passes into it through an intermediate state
of obscurity, even as night into day through twilight."
We tremble for those independent spirits
that shall live during that transitory period. That
twilight will be reddened by the reflection of
streams of human blood.</p>

<p>We fain would speed away from these European
lands, for we instinctively feel that we are in lands
under the curse of God, and smitten with darkness,
because their people had laid cruel hands upon
the lands and the people of learning and culture
and art.</p>

<p>But we must stay. We must note, distressing
though the duty be, the terrible influence which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
this ignorance exercised upon the morals of the
Church itself, and upon the mental and moral and
political and social and industrial state of the
people.</p>

EUROPE DURING THE DARK AGES.<br />

(CONTINUED.)</h2>



<p>GROSS SUPERSTITIONS.&mdash;A CRUCIFIX THAT SHED TEARS OF BLOOD.&mdash;THE
VIRGIN'S HOUSE CARRIED THROUGH THE AIR BY ANGELS.&mdash;SATAN
IN THE FORM OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.&mdash;SCENES IN HELL.&mdash;THE

HIS NAME.&mdash;FEUDAL LORDS AS HIGHWAY ROBBERS.&mdash;THE

<p class="p2">We promised to make a careful examination into
the influence which the ignorance of the clergy
exercised upon the aspect of religion, upon
the morals of the Church, and upon the
social, industrial, political, moral and mental
state of the people at large. We fear we
made a rash promise. So heart-rending are the
sights we see, if we are to give a faithful report,
those unacquainted with the state of European
civilization during the period which we are traversing,
we fear, may accuse us of exaggeration,
or worse still, may think that we, who belong to
the race that suffered most during that period
from the corruption of the Church, are animated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
by a spirit of revenge, and, therefore, find intense
delight in holding so revolting a picture before
our readers. But, happily, our readers are not
composed of such. We are addressing intelligent
people, men and women who know that our people
have suffered too terribly and too unjustly
from false accusations during many, many centuries,
to render ourselves guilty of the same
crime; men and women who know, that it is not
from choice, but from historic necessity, that we
contrast the social, and moral and intellectual
state of Christian Europe during the Dark Ages,
with the social and moral and intellectual state of
Moorish and Jewish Europe of the same period,
to appreciate the better the wonderful civilization
of "<i>The Jews and Moors in Spain</i>."</p>

<p>Our search discloses to us the sad and terrible
truth that ignorance, especially active ignorance, is
the mother of superstition, and both the parents of
fanaticism, and the offspring of this trio is deliberate
imposture, extortion, corruption, crime, and these,
in their turn, beget the world's misfortunes. This
sad truth stares us in the face whatever church,
cathedral, monastery or community we enter.
Everywhere miracles and relics and idolatry.
Everywhere the teaching and preaching of hell
and Satan and witchcraft, and of the necessity of
blind credulity and unquestioning belief. Every
cathedral and monastery has its tutelar saint, and
every saint his legend, and wondrous accounts are
spread concerning the saint's power, for good or
evil, often fabricated to enrich the church or monastery
under his protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
In Dublin we see the crucifix that sheds tears
of blood. In Loretto we see the house once inhabited
by the Virgin, and we were told, that
some angels, chancing to be at Nazareth when
the Saracen conquerors approached, fearing that
the sacred relic might fall into their possession,
took the house bodily in their hands, and, carrying
it through the air, deposited it at its present
place. In Bavaria they show us the brazen
android which Albertus Magnus had so cunningly
contrived as to serve him for a domestic, and
whose garrulity had so much annoyed the studious
Thomas Aquinas. In Alsace the abbot
Martin shows us the following inestimable relics,
which he had obtained for his monastery: a
spot of the blood of Jesus, a piece of the true
cross, the arm of the apostle James, part of the
skeleton of John the Baptist, a bottle of milk of
the blessed Virgin, and, with an ill-disguised envy,
he told us that a finger of the Holy Ghost is preserved
in a monastery at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Everywhere we are told that the arch fiend and
his innumerable legions of demons are forever
hovering about us, seeking our present unhappiness
and the future ruin of mankind; that we are at
no time, and at no place, safe from them; that we
cannot be sufficiently on our guard against them,
for sometimes they assume the shape of a grotesque
and hideous animal; sometimes they appear
in the shape of our nearest and dearest relatives
and friends; sometimes as a beautiful woman,
alluring by more than human charms, the
unwary to their destruction, and laying plots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
which were but too often successful against the
virtue of the saints; sometimes the Evil One assumes
the shape of a priest, and, in order to
bring discredit upon that priest's character, maliciously
visits, in this saintly disguise, some
very questionable places and allows himself to
be caught in most disgraceful situations and environments.
Can we imagine an invention more
ingenius to hide the foul practices of the corrupt
among the clergy?</p>

<p>Everywhere the clergy finds it a very profitable
traffic to teach how the people might protect
themselves against the Evil One. The sign of
the cross, a few drops of Holy water, the name
of the Virgin, the Gospel of St. John around the
neck, a rosary, a relic of Christ or of a saint, suffice
to baffle the utmost efforts of diabolic malice,
and to put the Spirits of Evil to an immediate
and ignominious flight.</p>

<p>There is not a Church, not a monastery that
we enter, but that our blood is chilled at its
fountain, as we gaze upon the ghastly paintings,
representing the horrible tortures of hell, placed
conspicuously for the contemplation of the faithful,
or for the fear of the wicked, or for the gain
of the clergy&mdash;for the heavier the purse the
church receives, the surer the release. It is impossible
to conceive more ghastly conceptions of
the future world than these pictures evinced, or
more hideous calumnies against that Being, who
was supposed to inflict upon His creatures such
unspeakable misery. On one picture the devil
is represented bound by red-hot chains, on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
burning gridiron in the center of hell. His hands
are free, and with these he seizes the lost souls,
crushes them like grapes against his teeth, and
then draws them by his breath down the fiery
cavern of his throat. Demons with hooks of red-hot
iron, plunge souls alternately into fire and ice.
Some of the lost are hung by their tongues,
others are sawn asunder, others are gnawed by
serpents, others are beaten together on an anvil,
and welded into a single mass, others are boiled
and strained through a cloth, others are twined
in the embraces of demons whose limbs are of
flames. But not only the guilty are represented
suffering thus, but also the innocent, who expiate
amidst heart-rending tortures the guilt of their
fathers.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A little boy is represented in his suffering.
His eyes are burning like two
burning coals. Two long flashes come out
of his ears. Blazing fire rolls out of his
mouth. An infant is represented roasting in a
hot oven. It turns and twists, it beats its head
against the roof of the oven in agony of its suffering.</p>

<p>Unable to gaze upon the scene of innocent suffering
any longer, we turn from it, trembling
with rage. We ask a priest, who chances to be
near, what fiend could calumniate thus the good
God? And smoothly he replies:</p>

<p>"God was very good to this child. Very likely
God saw it would get worse and worse and
would never repent, and so it would have to be
punished much more in hell. So God, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
mercy, called it out of the world in its early childhood."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>We no longer wonder at the stupidity of the
people, at the enormous wealth, and still greater
power of the clergy, when we remember that
the people were inoculated with the belief that
the clergy alone could save them from such eternal
tortures, and that money was the safest and
most potent redeemer, and the never failing mediator
for effacing the most monstrous crimes, and
for securing ultimate happiness.</p>

<p>We turn from these frightful sights only to encounter
more terrible scenes of misery. So far we
had gazed upon purely imaginary suffering, now
we encounter the real, the intensely real. Everywhere
we see the sky lurid from the reflection of
the <i>autos da fe</i>, on which thousands of innocently
accused victims, suffer the most agonizing and
protracted torments, without exciting the faintest
compassion. Everywhere we hear the prison
walls re-echo the piercing shrieks of women,
suffering the tortures preceding their conviction
as witches. And once, it was in Scotland, we
were the unfortunate spectators of a sight which
we never shall forget. While the act of burning
witches was being preformed amidst religious
ceremonies, with a piercing yell some of the women,
half burnt, broke from the slow fire that
consumed them, struggled for a few moments
with despairing energy among the spectators,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
until, with wild protestations of innocence, they
sank writhing in agony, breathing their last.</p>

<p>And why are these women burnt by the
thousands, everywhere, in Germany, France,
Spain, Italy, Flanders, Sweden, England, Scotland
and Ireland? Because they had entered into
a deliberate compact with Satan. They had
been seen riding at midnight through the air on
a broomstick or on a goat. They had worked
miracles thus infringing upon the monopoly of
the saints&mdash;or had afflicted the country with
comets, hailstorms, plagues, or their neighbors
with disease or barrenness. And who invents
so malicious a falsehood? Often the victims
themselves, for, suspected or accused of witchcraft
they are at once subjected to tortures, to force
a confession of their guilt, and these are so terrible,
that death is a release, and so they confess,
whatever the witch-courts want them to
confess. Many a husband cuts thus the marriage
tie which his church had pronounced indissoluble.
Many a dexterous criminal directs a charge of
witchcraft against his accuser, and thus escapes
with impunity.</p>

<p>Everywhere we find the whole body of the
clergy, from pope to priest, busy in the chase for
gain; what escapes the bishop is snapped up by
the archdeacon, what escapes the archdeacon is
nosed and hunted down by the dean, while a host
of minor officials prowl hungrily around these
great marauders. To give money to the priest is
everywhere regarded as the first article of the
moral code. In seasons of sickness, of danger, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
sorrow, or of remorse, whenever the fear or the
conscience of the worshiper is awakened he is
taught to purchase the favor of the saint. St.
Eligus gives us this definition of a good Christian:
"He who comes frequently to church, who presents
an oblation that it may be offered to God on the altar,
who does not taste the fruits of his land till
he has consecrated a part of them to God, who
offers presents and tithes to churches, that on
the judgment day he may be able to say: "Give
unto us Lord for we have given unto Thee;" who
redeems his soul from punishment, and finally
who can repeat the creeds or the Lord's prayer."</p>

<p>Bad as we find their greed, we find their moral
corruption indescribably worse. Void of every
sting of conscience, drunken, lost in sensuality
and open immorality. In Italy, a bishop informs
us, that were he to enforce the canons against unchaste
people administering ecclesiastical rites,
no one would be left in the Church, except the
boys. Everywhere, clergymen, sworn to celibacy,
take out their "<i>culagium</i>," their license to
keep concubines, and more than one council, and
more than one ecclesiastical writer we find speaking
of priestly corruption far greater than simple
concubinage, prominently among whom they
mention, Pope John XXIII, abbot elect of St.
Augustine, at Canterbury, the abbot of St. Pelayo,
in Spain, Henry III Bishop of Liege, and they
enumerate the countless nunneries, that are degraded
into brothels, and are flagrant for their
frequent infanticides.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a need for our reporting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
concerning the influence, which this moral depravity
of the Church has upon the masses. We
find that the ignorance and the corruption and
the bigotry made the people fully as ignorant and
corrupt and vicious. The pernicious doctrine already
adopted in the fourth century, that it is an
act of virtue to deceive and lie, when by that
means the interests of the church might be promoted,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
leads the people to the conclusion
that nothing can be possibly wrong, which leads
to the promotion of the Church's interests
and finances. And so crimes are perpetrated,
wrongs committed, deceptions practiced,
vice indulged without a pang of conscience, or a
throb of the gentler emotions. Ignorance deadens
every finer feeling, and religion, instead, of
elevating man's moral nature, crushes it by the
opportunities it offers for canceling crime with
money, and for saving the soul from eternal torture
and damnation by increasing the clergy's opportunities
for debauchery.</p>

<p>We next look for the intellectual accomplishments,
but we look in vain. The masses are intensely
ignorant. The clergy can not instruct
them, neither would they, if they could. Knowledge
among the masses would have seriously
interfered with their all-controlling power, as it
really did in later centuries. This ignorance is
fully shared by the secular chiefs of the land.
Kings repudiate book-learning as unworthy of
the crown, and warlike nobles despise it as disgraceful
to the sword. It is a rare thing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
not considered an accomplishment, to find a warrior
who can read or write. To suppose that he
can write is to insult him by mistaking him for
an ecclesiastic. No less a personage than Philippe
le Bel, the powerful monarch of United
France who conducts foreign wars and exterminates
the Templars, signs his name with the
sign of the cross or a rude arrow head, as late as
the thirteenth century. Let us not forget, that
nearly three hundred years earlier in the world's
history, we had found public schools, academies,
universities, libraries, poets, artists, scientists and
philosophers flourishing among the Moors and
Jews of Cordova&mdash;had seen Al Hakem the
Caliph, writing a digest on the fly-leaves of the
contents of each of his books in his great library.</p>

<p>We next look for the Industries, and there is
little to be found that can be honored with that
name. A belief prevails among the people that
the millenium, the end of the world, will set in,
amidst terrible sufferings at the year 1000. This
belief stifles industry, and property and wealth
are turned over to the Church for the sake of the
soul's release. Next come the Crusades and
these sap Europe of the flower of its people,
who leave by the thousands and hundreds of
thousands (and of which numbers but few return),
to keep the Moslems out of Jerusalem, while
the aged and the infirm, the women and children,
eke out a miserable existence at home, feeding
on beans, vetches, roots, bark of trees&mdash;often
horseflesh and mare's milk furnish a delicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
repast. During the intervals between the various
Crusades those few who return, are so accustomed
to their roving and plundering life that it
is impossible for them to settle down to mechanical
or industrial pursuits.</p>

<p>The Jews devote themselves almost exclusively
to the industries, and for this they suffer much.
Commerce is not safe. The feudal lords descend
from their fortresses to pillage the merchant's
goods. The highways are besieged by
licensed robbers, who confiscate the merchandise,
murder the owners, or sell them as slaves, or exact
enormous ransoms. Might makes right, and
the most powerful are the most distinguished for
their unscrupulous robberies. Their castles,
erected on almost inaccessible heights among the
pathless woods, become the secure receptacles of
predatory bands, who spread terror over the
country and make traffic and enterprise insecure
and next to impossible. And as it is on land so
it is at sea, where a vessel is never secure
from an attack of the pirates, and where neither
restitution nor punishment of the criminals is obtained
from governments, which sometimes fear
the plunderer and sometimes connive at the offense.</p>

<p>The political state of Europe we find still
worse. The word <i>liberty</i> has not yet found its
way into the dictionaries of the people. By far
the greater part of society is everywhere bereaved
of its personal liberty.</p>

<p>Everyone that is not Noble is a slave. Warfare
is the rule of the day. The Church tramples upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
kings and nobles; these, in their turn, such is
the prestige of the feudal system, tyrannize over
the next lower order, the next lower order apes
the example of its superior upon its inferior, and
so on from lower to lower caste, till the lowest,
the peasants, who have sunk into a qualified
slavery called serfdom. The fight for supremacy
between Church and State, the dreadful oppression
of the several orders of feudalism, convulses
society with their perennial feuds, the pride of
the countries are either cruelly butchered or employed
more frequently in laying waste the fields
of their rivals, or putting the destructive firebrand,
or the ruthless sword upon the prosperity
of their foe, than improving their own.</p>

<p>Let this report, meager as it is, suffice. The
ignorance and misery and suffering and cruelties
that abound everywhere are too revolting to
tempt a longer stay. Like Ajax, we pray for
light. Away from the jaws of darkness.</p>

<p>Ye sailors, ho! furl your sails, raise the anchor,
clear the harbor. And thou goodly vessel,
staunch and strong, hie thee straight across the
foaming deep. And thou, O Aeolus, blow cheerily
and lustily thy southern winds upon us. And
thou, O Neptune, speed thou our course, haste
us back again to fair Andalusia, to beauteous
Cordova, for there is no spot on earth like Cordova,
"the city of the seven gates," "the tent of
Islam," "the abode of the learned," "the meeting
place of the eminent," the city of parks and palaces,
aqueducts and public baths, the city of
chivalrous knights and enchanting ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Aeolus and Neptune answer our prayer. The
goodly ship she spins along. "She walks the
waters like a thing of life." Soon the lands we
eager seek will be descried, and, once again upon
the sunny shore, we shall continue our observations,
and freely share them with our friend
upon Columbia's virgin soil.</p>

<p class="p2">Again our light-winged boat glides upon the
broad and silvery bosom of the majestic Guadalquiver,
along parks filled with flowering shrubs,
along glittering palaces and song-resounding
woods, along palmy islets, and sweet scented and
crimson-tinted hills.</p>

<p>It is an early spring morning, nearly 1,000
years back in the world's history. Our boat
makes a sudden turn, and Cordova, all glistening
in the morning dew, raises her head as if
from a bath in the crystal stream. Aurora, goddess
of the dawn, blushes in the sky, and with
her rosy fingers she sports playfully with the
golden tresses of Andalusia's fairest daughter.
It is morn,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="line">"When the magic of daylight awakes</div>
<div class="line">A new wonder each moment, as slowly it breaks;</div>

<div class="line">Out of darkness, as if but just born of the sun."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
It is with difficulty that our agile oarsman, the
raven-locked and graceful featured Jewish youth,
whose services as guide we have again secured,
makes his way among the countless pleasure boats
that ply to and fro. We marvel at this, for distinctly
we remember how the broad stream was
furrowed during our first visit by boats of traffic
only. "It is Friday, the Mohammedan Sabbath,"
our guide informs us, and we no longer wonder.
The boats, some gilded, some festooned, some
decked with the richest tapestry, are peopled
with gay and happy pleasure seekers. The
whole youth of Cordova seems to disport itself
upon the water. The air re-echoes their merry
laughters and their music:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="line">"From psaltery, pipe and lutes of heavenly thrill,</div>
<div class="line">Or there own youthful voices, heavenlier still."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The winged chorister of the woods and parks
take up the refrain, and warble their sweetest,
as if in contest with voices human for supremacy
in song. But what is most strange and most
charming is the continual challenge between the
oarsmen for repartee songs, which are either extemporized
at the moment, or quotations from
their numerous poets. A boat crosses our path,
stays our course, and its oarsman to test our
guide's readiness to sing Cordova's praise, thus
begins in the sweet tones of the poetic Arabic
tongue:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="line">"Do not talk of the court of Bagdad and its glittering magnificence.</div>
<div class="line">Do not praise Persia and China, and their manifold advantages,</div>
<div class="line">For there is no spot on earth like Cordova,</div>
<div class="line">Nor in the whole world beauties like its beauties."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
To which our guide instantly replies, with a
sweet and pure tenor voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="line">"O, my beloved Cordova!</div>
<div class="line">Where shall I behold thine equal.</div>
<div class="line">Thou art like an enchanted spot,</div>
<div class="line">Thy fields are luxuriant gardens,</div>
<div class="line">Thy earth of various colors</div>
<div class="line">Resembles a flock of rose colored amber."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The challenging oarsman had met his peer.
He is pleased with the reply and clears the path.
Now our oarsman impedes the path of a boat,
and taking for his theme, "The Ladies," challenges
its oarsman thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Bright is the gold and fair the pearl,</div>
<div class="line">But brighter, fairer, thou, sweet girl.</div>
<div class="line">Jacinths and emeralds of the mine,</div>
<div class="line">Radiant as sun and moon may shine,</div>
<div class="line">But what are all their charms to thine?"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To which the challenged replies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>We have reached the landing place. Again
we tread in the streets of Cordova, that had surprised
and delighted us so much during our first
visit. We have not advanced far, when suddenly
there breaks on our ear a voice, loud and
mighty, as never heard before. We look in the
direction whence the voice comes, and on the
graceful balcony around the "minaret"&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
"muezzin," who calleth, with a solemn power in
his living voice, which neither flag, trumpet, bell
nor fire could simulate or rival, the Faithful thus
to prayer:</p>

<p>"Come to prayer! Come to prayer! Come to
the Temple of Salvation! Great God! Great
God! There is no God except God!"</p>

<p>At the sound of the <i>muezzin's</i> call, the throngs
that crowd the streets hasten their steps, while
some few stop, and turning towards the Kiblah&mdash;(point
of the heaven in the direction of Mecca,
which is indicated by the position of the minarets,)
either prostrate themselves upon the ground, or,
folding their arms across their bosom, bow their
turbaned head to the ground, and raise their
heart and voice to Allah. Five times, every day,
our guide informs us, the <i>muezzin</i> calls the faithful
to prayer. Those who are thus worshiping
publicly upon the streets, are for some reasons
prevented from attending the mosque, and the
Koran allows them to pray in any clean place,
and the streets of Cordova are clean indeed.
Prayer is great with the Moors, our guide continues.
Mohammed has laid great stress upon
its efficacy and importance. "It is the pillar of
religion and the key to paradise," said he. "Angels
come among you both by night and day,
when they ascend to heaven God asks them how
they left his creatures. We found them, say
they, at their prayers, and we left them at their
prayers." Even the postures to be observed in
prayer he had prescribed. Females in prayer
are not to stretch forth their arms, but to hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
them on their bosoms. They are not to make as
deep inflexions as the men. They are to pray
in a low and gentle tone of voice. They are not
permitted to accompany the men to the mosque,
lest the mind of the worshipers should be drawn
from their devotions. Neither are they allowed
to worship together with the men. They have
their gallery in the mosque fenced in with latticework.
No one is permitted to go to prayer
decked with costly ornaments or clothed in sumptuous
apparel.</p>

<p>While listening to our guide, our feet unconsciously
followed the hastening throngs,
and before we were aware of it we stood before
the "mezquita," the great mosque, the famous
edifice which, with its buildings and courts, covers
more space than any place of worship in
existence, the rival of the <i>Caaba</i> at Mecca, and
of the <i>Alaksa</i> of Jerusalem. Like all Moorish
architecture, its exterior is very plain. Our guide
gives us its dimensions; it is 642 feet long and 440
wide. The height of the Alminar tower is 250 feet.</p>

<p>This is Friday, the "<i>Yawn al Yoma</i>" the great
day of assembly for worship, the Mohammedan
Sabbath, sacred because on that day man was
created, because that day had already been consecrated
by the early Arabians to "Astarte," Venus,
the most beautiful of the planets and the brightest
of the stars; and, also because from that day,
Friday (July 16, 622,) the day of the <i>Hegira</i>, begins
the Mohammedan calendar. Our guide assures
us that there are special services on Friday,
that on this day the <i>Mufti</i> expounds some chap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>ters
from the Koran, and the "<i>Imaum</i>" (preacher,)
delivers a "<i>Khotbeh</i>" (sermon).</p>

<p>We enter through one of the nineteen lofty
and massive bronze gates, and the beauties we
now behold baffle description.</p>

<p>The "<i>Kiblah</i>" is reached by nineteen aisles,
marked by columns of jasper, beryl, verd-antique,
porphyry, finely carved, supporting in two
directions double horseshoe arches, one above
the other. These are crossed by thirty-eight
aisles, also composed of columns of different
marbles, making thus literally a forest of columns.
The ceiling is filled with ovals inscribed with appropriate
inscriptions from the Koran, to call the
mind of the faithful to contemplation and devotion.
From it are suspended 280 chandeliers,
which light the vast space with upwards of 10,000
lights.</p>

<p>The "<i>Al Mihrab</i>" at the "<i>Kiblah</i>" end of the
mosque is an octagonal niche, the ceiling of
which is formed like a shell out of a single block
of white marble. Within it is the Shrine of
Shrines, containing one of the original copies of
the Koran, the one which lay upon the lap of
<i>Othman</i>, the third Caliph, our guide tells us,
when he was assassinated; it is stained with his
life blood. It lies upon a lecturn of aloe wood,
put together with golden nails. The doors of
the shrine are pure gold, the floor solid silver,
inlaid with gold and <i>lapis lazuli</i>. In front of it is
the pulpit made of costly woods, inlaid with ivory
and enriched with jewels; the nails joining its
parts are also of gold and silver. It is the gilt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the Caliph, and the cost exceeds $1,000,000.
The Caliph himself drew the plan of the entire
edifice, and assisted daily with his own hands in
its erection.</p>

<p>Within the mosque there is a court 220 feet
long, containing promenades which invite to devout
meditations, and reservoirs and fountains
for their ablution, for, as our guide informs us, ablution
is enjoined by the Koran, with great precision
as preparative to prayer; purity of body being
considered emblematical of purity of soul.</p>

<p>There is not a seat in the entire edifice; the
worshipers are either prostrated upon the floor,
which is artistically paved with marble mosaics,
or they stand profoundly bent in reverence.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>As the Mufti, his careful ablutions being completed,
approaches the "<i>Al Mihrab</i>," to take
from its sacred Shrine the copy of the Koran, all
prostrate themselves on the ground. He opens
the book, and with a loud voice he reads the first
"<i>sura</i>," chapter:</p>

<p>"<i>Bismillah</i>"&mdash;in the name of the most merciful
God. Praise be to God, the Lord of all creatures,
the Most Merciful, the King of the Day of
Judgment. Thee do we worship, and of Thee do
we beg assistance. Direct us in the right way,
in the way of those to whom Thou hast been gracious;
not of those against whom thou art incensed,
not of those who go astray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>To which the whole congregation responds:</p>

<p>"God, there is no God but He, the Living, the
Ever Living; He sleepeth not, neither doth He
slumber. To Him belongeth the Heavens and
the earth, and all that they contain. He knoweth
the Past and the Future, but no one can comprehend
anything of this knowledge but that
which He revealeth. His sway extendeth over
the Heavens and the Earth, and to sustain them
both is no burden to Him. He is the high, the
mighty. There is no God besides Him, and
"<i>Mohammed Resul Allah</i>" Mohammed is the prophet
of God."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The <i>Mufti</i> now expounds a
chapter from the Koran, and at the end of each of
its lessons the whole congregation responds,
"Amin!" "So be it."</p>

<p>The "<i>Imaum</i>" ascends the pulpit to preach his
sermon. He bases his theme upon the chapter
just expounded. He speaks of faith and practice,
of faith in God, in his angels, in his Koran, in his
prophets, in the resurrection and final judgement,
in predestination. "Angels," he says, keep continual
watch upon each mortal, one on the right
hand, the other on the left, taking note of every
word or action. At the close of each day they
fly up to heaven to write up their report. Every
good action is recorded ten times by the good
angel on the right, and if the mortal commit a sin
the same benevolent spirit says to the angel on
the left: "Forbear for seven hours to record it;
peradventure he may repent and pray and obtain
forgiveness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>He enjoins a reverence for the <i>Al Koran</i>, and
a scrupulous obedience to its precepts. In it are
written all the decrees of God, and all events past,
present or to come. It had existed from all eternity
and was treasured up in the seventh heaven,
and its contents were finally revealed to Mohammed
by the Angel Gabriel.</p>

<p>He speaks of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses,
Jesus, as prophets subordinate to Mohammed,
whose life and preceipts are worthy of following.</p>

<p>He speaks of predestination, and says that every
event is predetermined by God, that the destiny
of every individual and the hour of his death are
irrevocably fixed, and can neither be varied nor
evaded, by any effort of human sagacity or
foresight.</p>

<p>He reconciles fate and free-will by saying:
"The outline is given us we color the picture of
life as we will."</p>

<p>He speakes of Charity, and says that every
one must dispense, in one way or the other, a
tenth of his revenue in the relief of the indigent
or distressed. He speakes of the great virtue of
fasting and says: "Prayer leads us half way to
God, fastening conveys us to His threshold and
alms conducts us into His presence." He enjoins
the doing of good and the shunning of evil, and
above all an observance of the golden rule.</p>

<p>"If these precepts ye obey," he concludes, "the
pleasures of Paradise will be your reward. There
you will be clothed in raiments sparkling with
jewels. You will wear crowns of gold enriched
with pearls and diamonds, and dwell in sumptu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>ous
palaces or silken pavilions, reclining in voluptuous
couches. Hundreds of attendants, bearing
dishes and goblets of gold, will serve you
with every variety of exquisite viands and beverage,
whenever and in whatever quantity you shall
want them. There the air, fragrant with the sweetest
perfume, resounds with the melodious voices of
the Daughters of Paradise. There, besides your
wives you had on earth, who will rejoin you in all
their pristine charms, black-eyed <i>Hooreeyahs</i>
(Houris) having complexions like rubies and
pearls, resplendent beings, free from every human
defect or frailty, perpetually retaining their
youth and beauty, will constantly attend you, and
cheerfully obey your wishes."</p>

<p>"But woe unto you if ye harken not to the words
of <i>Allah</i> and Mohammed his prophet! When ye
shall pass the bridge, <i>Al Sirat</i>, which is finer
than a hair and sharper than a sword, it will
break beneath the burden of your sins, and precipitate
you into the shadow and smoke and fire
of hell."</p>

<p>With a prayer for the welfare of the Caliph and
the entire government, the "khotbeh" is ended
and the congregation dismissed.</p>

<p>We know that the Moors and Jews are Oriental
people, and, therefore, not indigenous to the
Occidental soil they now inhabit. Whence
came they? Why came they? We are eager
for a correct answer to these questions, and knowing
none of Cordova's learned men, we think of
our distinguished co-religionist. <i>Abu Jussuf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Chasdai ben Isaac Ibn Shaprut</i>, the Jewish Physician,
Philologist, Minister of Foreign Affairs, of
Commerce and Finance to the learned <i>Abder
Rahman</i>, and <i>Nasi</i>, or secular chief, of all European
Jews. We take the heart to visit him, and
with the aid of our guide, we soon are admitted
into the house. There we learn that <i>Chasdai
Ibn Shaprut</i> had just been summoned to a secret
consultation with the Caliph concerning an important
embassy that had come from <i>Otto I</i>,
Emperor of Germany. We are asked to await
his return in his library. There, we are introduced
to <i>Moses ben Chanoch</i>, the distinguished
Talmudist, to his pupil, <i>Joseph ben Abitur</i>, the
translator of the <i>Mishnah</i> into Arabic for the
Caliph's library, to <i>Menachem ben Saruk</i>, the
grammarian and compiler of the first Hebrew
lexicon, and to <i>Dunash ben Labrat</i>, the distinguished
poet, who were pursuing their respective
studies in the magnificent library of Chasdai, the
Jewish favorite Minister to the Caliph.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We state our wish, and Dunash ben Labrat
thus replies:</p>

<p>"We know not when our distinguished <i>Nasi</i>
will return. If, indeed, it be agreeable to you, I
will ask you to accompany me to my friend <i>Abdallah
Ibn Xamri</i>, the famous Moorish poet and
erudite historian, with whom I have arranged a
game of chess for this afternoon's siesta. He
will, I know, give you such information concerning
the history of the Arab-Moors as you may
desire. When this shall have been done, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
shall make our way back again, Chasdai will have
returned, and he will gladly give you an account
of the Entrance of the Jews into Spain."</p>

<p>We cheerfully accept his kind proposal. We
are on our way now, and in the following chapter
we shall faithfully report all that we shall see and
hear.</p>

<p class="p2">In a beautiful valley on the banks of the Guadalquivir,
about five miles from Cordova, within
sight of the Caliph's magnificent palace of <i>Medina-al-Zohar</i>
(town of the flower) stands the picturesque
residence of the Moorish poet, Abdallah
Ibn Xamri. Dunash ben Labrat, the distinguished
Jewish poet, our new found friend and guide,
has no need for a formal announcement. A
massive bronze gate opens into a beautifully
paved court yard, from the center of which issues
the never-failing fountain jet to a dazzling height,
diffusing refreshing coolness and making a pleasant
patter of the falling drops into the basin. A
gallery encircles this court, supported by slender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
columns of alabaster, from which spring numbers
of graceful horseshoe arches. The interspaces
above the arches are filled with arabesques, interwreathing
striking texts from the Koran in brilliant
red and blue and gold. Above these are
the latticed windows which light the seraglio.</p>

<p>From this luxurious court we pass through a double
archway into another, abounding with tropical
plants. Here within the concealment of the
densest shade trees, is a very long oblong marble
basin, supplied with artificially cooled water.
Here, in the early morning and in the evening
twilight, the indolent, the warm, the weary bathe
in luxurious languor. Here the women meet to
disport themselves, while the entrances are
guarded by eunuchs against intrusion. From
this private court a postern leads into a beautiful
garden with mazy walks and blooming <i>parterres</i>,
replete with artificial grottoes and kiosks of stained
glass, and terraces of polished marbles, and
balustrades supported by guilded columns, and
ponds filled with gold and silver fishes.</p>

<p>"Here we shall find Abdallah Ibn Xamri," says
Dunash ben Labrat; "he delights to take his
siesta within yonder pavilion, which is well provided
with books and musical instruments.
There his beautiful daughter <i>Zelica</i> tunes the
lyre as he courts the muses, and her melodious
voice has inspired his most wondrous lyric
gems."</p>

<p>Abdallah recognizes Dunash's voice, and bids
him enter. We obey the summons. Surprise is
visible in Abdallah's countenance as he gazes up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>on
our strange faces. Before us stands a typical
Moor. His person is well formed. He has an
oval face, aquiline nose, long and arched eyebrow,
nearly meeting, large restless black eyes,
smooth skin, clear olive complexion, full dark
hair and beard, and an elastic springy step. His
head is covered with a green woolen cap of
cylindrical form from which hangs a blue tassel.
Over a long straight robe of light cloth, he wears a
shorter tunic, elaborately embroidered. Sandals
are tied to his feet with strings of twisted silver
and gold.</p>

<p>We exchange <i>Salams</i>. Our friend introduces
us. In measured rhyme he states that he had
brought us to Cordova's distinguished son of the
muses to learn from the most authentic source
the "History of the entrance of the Arab-Moors into
Spain." Abdallah receives us cordially, asks us
to recline upon the <i>divan</i>&mdash;the cushioned seats running
along the walls of the pavilion&mdash;he takes
his reclining position opposite us, and after a
few introductory remarks he speaks as follows:</p>

<p>"The great peninsula, formed by the Red Sea,
by the Euphrates, by the Gulf of Persia
and by the Indian ocean, and known by the
name of Arabia, is the birthplace of our creed.
It was peopled soon after the deluge by the children
of <i>Shem</i>, the son of Noah. In course of
time the brave <i>Yarab</i> established the kingdom
of <i>Yemen</i>, whence the Arabs derive the names
of themselves and their country. During a long
succession of ages, extending from the earliest
period of recorded history down to the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
century, Arabia remained unchanged and unaffected
by the events which convulsed the rest of
Asia and shook Europe and Africa to their very
center. The occupations of the people were
trade and agriculture. The former had ports
along the coasts, and carried on foreign trade by
means of ships and caravans. The nomadic
Arabs were the more numerous of the two. The
necessity of being always on the alert to defend
their flocks and herds made these familiar from
their infancy, with the exercise of arms. No one
could excel them in the use of the bow, the
lance and the scimitar, and the adroit and graceful
management of the horse. They were more
at home on horseback than on foot. The horse
was their friend and companion. They lived and
talked with him and lavished upon him their
dearest affection, and both were capable of sustaining
great fatigue and hardship. The Arabs
possessed in an eminent degree the intellectual
attributes of the Shemitic race. Penetrating sagacity,
subtle wit, a ready conception, a brilliant
imagination, a proud and daring spirit were
stamped upon their sallow visage, and flashed from
their dark and kindling eye. Our language, naturally
poetic, made them poets and the most eloquent
of men. They were generous and hospitable.
Their deadliest foe, having once broken bread
with them, could repose securely beneath the inviolable
sanctity of their tent. Their religion
originally consisted of a belief in the unity of
God, in future life, in the necessity of prayer and
virtue. This was the creed of Abraham and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
brought to them by Ishmael and Hagar. In the
course of time it became contaminated with
Sabean star worship and Magian idolatry."</p>

<p>"When Palestine was ravaged by the Romans,
and the city of Jerusalem taken and sacked,
many of the Jews took refuge among them, and
gradually many of the tenets of the Jewish faith
and practices of the Jewish worship were again
insensibly adopted by them. The same refuge
Arabia offered later to many Christians who
were fleeing from the persecutions of Rome, and
these also engrafted gradually, some of their rites
and ceremonies and beliefs upon the people.
The result was a mixture of religious beliefs, the
highest religious principles alternating with the
most degrading idolatries. There was no accepted
creed, no unified faith."</p>

<p>A great reformer was needed, and the great
<i>Allah</i> sent his prophet, <i>Mohammed</i>, to establish
the only true faith: <i>Islamism</i>. His birth was accompanied
by signs and portents, announcing a
child of wonder.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> At the moment of his coming
into the world, a celestial light, illuminated the
surrounding country, and the new-born child,
raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed "God is
great! There is no God but God, and I am his
Prophet." Heaven and earth were agitated at
his advent. Palaces, and temples and mountains
toppled to the earth. The fires, sacred to Zoroaster,
which had burned, without interruption
for upwards of a thousand years, were suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
extinguished, and all the idols in the world fell
down. Though his true Messiahship was thus
made evident at his birth, and in his youth, he
still waited to the age of fully ripened manhood
before he made the attempt of establishing the
creed, which the angel Gabriel had written down
for him upon palm leaves. But when the time
had come for raising his own nation from fetichism,
from the adoration of a meteoric stone, and
from the basest idol worship, he awakened his
people out of their religious and political torpor,
kindled the fire of enthusiasm among them, and
they thirsted after opportunities for contest and
conquests.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When death took the sword from his hand ten
years later, the whole world trembled at the very
mention of his name.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here Abdallah pauses in his narrative. He
touches a silver bell, and soon a maiden appears.
This is the first time that we are permitted to
gaze upon a Moorish woman's face; those we
met in the streets or parks, or saw behind the
latticework of the woman's gallery in the mosque,
were always clothed in the mantilla, which
encircled their entire form, and their faces were
always hidden under the face veil, or under the
horsehair vizard, which left but the eyes visible.
She wears her hair braided. A light cap
or cornet, adorned with gems, forms the covering
for her head. The side locks are entwined
with coral beads, hung loosely to chinck with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
every movement. Full white muslin trousers are
tied at the ankle with golden strings that end in
merry little silver bells. A long full white mantle
of transparent muslin covers the tight-fitting
vest and jacket of silk, both of brilliant colors,
and embroidered and decorated with woven
gold. Around her neck and arms and wrists she
wears chains, necklaces and bracelets, of gold,
and of coral and pearls and amber.</p>

<p>He whispers something in her ear, and immediately
she disappears, light as an angel shape. A
deep silence ensues. At that moment we think
not of Mohammed, the founder of a new faith
and the conqueror of the world, but of <i>Zelica</i>,
Abdallah's daughter, that beauteous maiden,
whose complexion vies with the rubies and white
jasmine flowers she wears more radiant still when
her dazzling eyes drooped, and when the scarlet
hue of innocence mantled her face as her glance
met the eyes of men and strangers.</p>

<p>Abdallah had ordered refreshments. Servants
appear and spread an embroidered rug upon the
floor. Upon it they place a low tray, set with
silver and fine earthenware, and provided with
the choicest of fruits, confections and sherbets
flavored with violet. Low cushions are placed
around it, upon which we, following the example
of our host and guide, seat ourselves with our
legs crossed. Before eating, a servant pours
water on our hands from a basin and ewer. The
meal begins with "<i>Bismilah</i>" for grace. A very
interesting conversation, displaying great learning
and much reading, is carried on between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
two poets, as to whether Cordova or Bagdad
leads the world in literature, art, science, and
philosophy. Abdallah champions Cordova, Dunash
favors Bagdad, his native home.</p>

<p>The delicious repast is ended. The floor is
cleared, Abdallah resumes his narrative.</p>

<p>"The successors of Mohammed," says he, "followed
in the footsteps of our prophet. They passed
beyond the confines of Arabia, and persecuted
their work of converting the world, giving to the
conquered the choice between the Koran, or
Tribute, or Death. In less than fifty years after
the Prophet's death, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Mesopotamia,
Persia, Armenia, Asia Minor had accepted
the religion of Mohammed. In Jerusalem
a mosque stood on the site where once the
temple of Solomon stood. In Alexandria the
Mohammedans wrought direful vengeance on
Christians for the crimes which the arrogant and
fanatical St. Cyril had committed there two centuries
before, by extirpating Grecian learning and
by inciting his monks to murder the wise <i>Hypatia</i>."</p>

<p>The extreme northern part of Africa brought
their armies to a sudden halt. Here they encounter
two strong foes. First, the people called
<i>Berbers</i> "the Noble," a tall, noble looking race of
men, active, high-spirited and indomitable. They
had the same patriarchal habits, the same Shemitic
features, were equally skilled in the use of arms
and the breeding and handling of horses, and so
the Arabs believed them to be of their own race.
This Northern coast of Africa has been called by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the Romans, from the dark complexion of
its people: <i>Mauritania</i>, and its people were
called <i>Mooriscos</i>, or <i>Moors</i>. When the superior
force of the Arabians compelled the Moors to
submit at last, the conquerors and the conquered
coalesced so completely, that in less than a decade
the one could not be distinguished from the
other.</p>

<p>"The second foe, however, who inhabited the
Northern extremity of <i>Almagreb</i>, where the continent
of Africa protrudes boldly to meet the continent
of Europe, was not so easily overcome.
The rock-built city of <i>Ceuta</i> was garrisoned by
Spanish soldiers, and its brave commander,
Count <i>Julian</i>, defied the valiant Amir <i>Musa Ibn
Nosseyr</i>, the Hero of Two Continents. It seemed
as if <i>Islamism</i> had reached its limit, that it
would never set its foot upon beautiful Andalusia,
at which it had so often cast its wistful eye. But
<i>Allah</i> favored the onward march of the religion
of the Prophet! The wrong done by the wicked
<i>Roderick</i>, King of Spain, to the young and beautiful
<i>Florinda</i>, daughter of Count <i>Julian</i>, the
brave commander of <i>Ceuta</i>, opened Europe to the
Arab-Moors. "<i>By the living God</i>," exclaimed
the insulted father. "<i>I will be revenged.</i>"</p>

<p>He soon found willing allies, consisting of the
nobles, who could no longer endure the despotism
of King Roderick, and of the Jews, who had
been expelled from Spain. Encouraged by these
allies Count <i>Julian</i> entered into negotiations
with Amir <i>Musa</i> for the delivery of Spain into
his hands. Musa accepted cheerfully.</p>

<div class="line">And heat of zeal, a dreadful brotherhood."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The valiant <i>Tarik</i> crossed with a selected
force, the strait between the Pillars of Hercules,
which is now named after him "<i>Gibr-al-Tarik</i>"
(Gibraltar), "the rock of Tarik." On the 24th of
July, 711, the two armies met at the river of
Guadalete, not far from Xeres, and after a three
days' battle a small force of picked men, the indomitable
horsemen of the desert, routed 80,000
Spaniards, amidst terrible carnage. Tarik pressed
eagerly forward. <i>Cordova</i>, <i>Malaga</i>, <i>Toledo</i>, <i>Merida</i>,
surrendered after little or no opposition. In
six years later the Arab-Moors were complete
masters of Spain, and have been so unto this
day."</p>

<p>Abdallah has ended his narrative. Unconsciously,
it seems, he takes the lute at his side, and
running his fingers over the strings, he strikes a
few chords and finally, as if desirious of supplementing
his version of the entrance of Arab-Moors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
into Europe, he makes the lute accompany
his recital of some of the songs and verses he
had composed in commemoration of the victory
of the Arab-Moors over fair Andalusia, and
which have since become as popular in Bagdad
and Antioch as in Cordova or Granada. We
wish, but our wish is in vain, that <i>Zelica</i> might
return to her wonted task, that her young and
melodious voice might blend with the melting
strains of the Moorish bard.</p>

<p>The heroic theme inspires Abdallah more and
more. He begins to improvise. He defends
<i>Florinda</i>, whom the Spaniards execrate, and
name "<i>La Cava</i>"&mdash;"the Wicked." He sings of
Roderick's entering the cave over which was written:
"<i>The king who opens this cave and discovers
its wonders will learn both good and evil</i>,"
and, how upon entering it he read this fatal inscription
on the walls: "<i>Unhappy King, thou
hast entered in an evil hour. By strange nations
thou shalt be dispossessed, and thy people degraded</i>."
He sings of the combat between Tarik
and Roderick. He sings of the captive queen
<i>Egilona</i>. He sings of the jealousy between
Musa and Tarik, and of other themes, heroic
and beautiful.</p>

<p>The <i>muezzin's</i> summons to evening prayer
stops his muse, and makes our hasty departure
necessary, for it is Friday evening, and the
distance to the synagogue is long. We part
hastily. Before leaving, however, Abdallah exacts
a promise from Dunash that he will send for
him whenever Chasdai ben Isaac, the distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>ed
Jewish Minister to the Caliph, shall tell us the
<i>History of the Entrance of the Jews into Spain</i>.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
A SABBATH EVE IN CORDOVA.</h2>

<p>THE SYNAGOGUE OF CORDOVA.&mdash;THE DAUGHTERS OF ISRAEL PREPARING
FOR THE SABBATH.&mdash;THE THRONE OF THE "NASI."&mdash;RABBI MOSES
BEN CHANOCH.&mdash;THE ELOQUENCE OF SILENCE.&mdash;A TEARFUL
SCENE.&mdash;THREE RABBIS TAKEN CAPTIVE BY PIRATES.&mdash;EVIL
DESIGNS AGAINST CHANOCH'S YOUNG
AND BEAUTIFUL WIFE.&mdash;SOLD AS
SLAVE TO CORDOVA.&mdash;HIS
MIRACULOUS RISE.</p>


<p class="p2">A paved walk, guarded on each side by majestic
cypress trees, winding its course along terraced
gardens and near refreshing fountains,
leads up to the lofty eminence on which stands
the only synagogue of Cordova. Almost breathless
we reach the height. We express our surprise
that the Synagogue, visited twice daily, and
thrice on the Sabbath day, should have been located
so inconveniently, to which our distinguished
friend Dunash ben Labrat replies: "Such is
the custom in Israel, both Solomon<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and Ezra<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
have established the custom of building the Synagogue
on a lofty eminence, and the Talmud
teaches: "The city whose houses are higher
than its houses of worship will be destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Before entering, we pause awhile to cast our
eyes about us. Were we standing on Mount
Moriah, of deathless memory, with the gorgeous
temple of Solomon before us, and with the sacred
scenery of Jerusalem and her environments about
us, even such scenes could not have awed us
more than those which fascinate our heart and
mind on the temple-mount of Cordova, the
brightest gem in the proud diadem of fair Andalusia.</p>

<p>At the foot of the mount glides the silvery
Guadalquivir. The blushing sun is sinking behind
the azure hills, and houses and synagogues
and foliage and fountain and river, all are crimson
tinted, while the fleecy cloudlets, that float
in his radiant tracks, are resplendent with colors
of purple and violet and gold and red. The
evening star sparkles in the rosy sky so benignly,
as if it were the eye of God, pleased at
seeing His "chosen people" hasten to prostrate
themselves before His footstool. The golden
glimmering vapors, that rise from beneath the
illumined horizon into infinite space, seem to
vault over the Synagogue, as if bestowing celestial
Sabbath blessing over its worshipers. All
nature around us inspires to worship. The
nightingales have begun their evening hymns,
and the air is loud with the soft melting notes of
the skylarks, who sing their sweet "Good Night"
to the sunken sun. Our soul, too, is filled with
a yearning to commune with God, and so we turn
toward the synagogue.</p>

<p>Like the mezquita (mosque) its exterior facade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
is plain and unnoteworthy. We enter the high
and spacious vestibule, and our eye is dazzled
with all the magnificence, with the harmonious
blending of colors, with the costly, but chaste
ornamentations. The cupola above admits a
free circulation of air, bringing the sweet fragrance
of the surrounding gardens. On the one
side is heard the refreshing sound of the flowing
waters within the reservoirs for ablution, and
on the other side the soft splash from the fountain
jets in the garden.</p>

<p>Within the synagogue proper, clusters of delicate
columns of various marbles and of costly
woods, support double galleries, one above the
other, with lattice work in front, that the black-eyed
and raven-locked and comely-featured Hebrew
women may not draw the mind of the worshipers
beneath from their devotions. The galleries
are empty now. The Hebrew women do
not attend the service of the Sabbath Eve.
They are at home awaiting the return of their
husbands, fathers, brothers. All day long have
they been busy in the preparation for the Sabbath.
The house has been put in order. The choicest
that means would allow and the market afford
has been secured and prepared for the festive
Sabbath meal. Upon the table, decked with
snow white linens, and with the tempting dishes,
burn the lights in the heavy silver candlesticks,
and the traditional seven-armed Sabbath lamp,
suspended from the center of the ceiling, having
been lighted with Sabbath benedictions by the
queen of the house, sheds a hallowed light over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
mother, wife and daughter, who are attired in
their neatest, and whose countenances are flushed
from the day's busy task, and whose eyes
beam, and whose hearts beat with joyous expectations.</p>

<p>But we have strayed from the description of
the galleries of the synagogue to the women in
their homes. What wonder the Spanish Jews
had need of their latticed railings!</p>

<p>The interspaces between the graceful horseshoe
arches and the ovals in the ceiling are delicately
pencilled with brilliant colors, and the walls are
filled with arabesques interwreathing appropriate
Hebrew texts.</p>

<p>The wall to the east, the direction towards
Jerusalem, holds the <i>Haichal</i>, the shrine, in
which is kept the <i>Thora</i>, the parchment scrolls of
the Pentateuch.</p>

<p>The shrine is canopied by a wondrously designed
shell-shaped covering, inlaid with mother-of-pearl,
ivory and silver. A curtain of silk and
woven gold, and decorated with gems of chrysolite
and emeralds and sapphires, serves as a screen
to this "Holy of Holies." Over this shell-shaped
canopy is an illuminated window of artistic workmanship,
inscribed in brilliant colors with the
words, "<i>Yehi Or</i>," "Let there be light." The
moon, queen of the night, rides in the cloudless
sky, and she sends her peerless light through
this double-triangled window, and the effect is
most sublime.</p>

<p>Suspended from the ceiling, and directly in
front of the curtain is the <i>Ne'er Tamid</i> the "Per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>petual
Lamp," famous for its wondrous beauty
and for its priceless value, the gift of the mother
of <i>Chasdai ben Isaac</i>, and its mellow light
sends a hallowing influence over the congregants.
Beneath it are the pyramidal steps, from which
the descendants of the High-Priest Aaron bestow,
on the great holidays, the priestly blessings upon
the congregation. To the right and left of these
stand the <i>M'noroth</i>, the high seven-armed candelabra,
a faithful copy of the Biblical design<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.</p>

<p>In front of the steps stands the throne-like
chair, in which is seated <i>Chasdai ben Isaac</i>, the
<i>Nasi</i>, secular head of all European Jews, the
<i>Resh Kallah</i>, President of the Academy for the
Talmudical Sciences at Pumbadita in Babylonia,
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and of Commerce,
and of Finance to the Caliph Abderrahman III.</p>

<p>To the right of the shrine, on a raised platform,
are seated Rabbi <i>Moses ben Chanoch</i>, the
<i>Dayan</i>, the chief judge and chief rabbi of all
European Jews; at his right the <i>Sh'liach Hazibur</i>,
the Reader, is seated; at his left his Chief Assistant
<i>Dayan</i>; at his feet sit the most advanced
disciples of his far-famed academy.</p>

<p>To the left of the "Shrine" is seated the <i>Rosh
Hak'neseth</i>, the President of the congregation;
behind his chair stands the <i>Chazan Hak'neseth</i>, the
beadle, to his right and left the officers of the congregation
are seated, at their feet sit the elders.</p>

<p>These three groups sit with their faces towards
the congregation, while the congregation faces
the shrine. In the center of this capacious inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>ior
is the "Almemor," or the "Bimah," a spacious
elevated platform of magnificent design. A balustrade
encircles this platform, whose balusters,
as well as those of the graceful stairways that lead
up to the platform on both sides, are of delicate
alabaster columns. On this "Bimah" is the Reader's
desk, and the Rabbi's pulpit, placed there, that
the vast audience may have the opportunity of
advantageous hearing.</p>

<p>From the ceiling great chandeliers are suspended,
which shed a shower of light upon the host of
worshipers, and streaming through the inexpressibly
beautiful stained-glass windows, the synagogue,
that towers high above the city of Cordova,
sheds its benign rays of holiness and peace
and good will over the city and all its people.</p>

<p>The floor of the vestibule is composed of marble,
mosaics and glazed tiles, so joined as to form
various complicated patterns of surpassing beauty.
The floor of the synagogue is covered with embroidered
Persian carpets.</p>

<p>Though the seats are filled, and the officers are
in their respective places&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"No sound is uttered&mdash;but a deep</div>
<div class="line">And solemn harmony pervades."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Verily, the Hebrews understand the essence of
worship well. There is in every prayerful soul
that indefinable yearning and longing after the
infinite, after the highest and the sublimest that
can give eloquent utterance in deep silence only.
The soul may stammer forth its wants and its
thanks, but its deepest, innermost feelings never.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Therefore have the Jews established the custom
that the service of expression shall ever be preceded
by the still more sacred service of silent
meditation.</p>

<p>The strange surroundings, and the wondrous
sights, have so completely taken hold of our mind
that it cannot find that calm repose so necessary
for silent devotion, and so, while the others are
lost in meditations our mind, continues its observations.</p>

<p>Two men rivet our attention. The one is
<i>Chasdai ben Isaac</i>, one of those awe-and-respect-commanding
and love-and-confidence-inspiring
appearances we meet with but rarely in life. His
features present an embodiment of three distinct
races. His high and square forehead, his deep-set
eye, his aquiline nose, his prominent chin,
indicative of profound wisdom, of capacities to
command and of great will power; these bespeak
the Palestinian Hebrew. The grace and comeliness
of the figure bespeak the Moor. His tall,
majestic form, full of life and vigor, bespeak the
European Visigoth.</p>

<p>No less attractive is the person of Rabbi <i>Moses
Ben Chanoch</i>. There is something strange and
fascinating in his intelligent countenance. Some
strange, sweet melancholy seems to hover about
his eyes. The lines of his face fall into an expression
of mild suffering, of endurance sweetened and
sustained by holiness and resignation to God's
will. He seems to be more deeply lost in meditation
than any of the rest. Now and then his
forehead wrinkles, and his lips quiver, as if in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
pain, and his teeth close, as if suppressing a cry
of anguish.</p>

<p>Is the great and learned and pious Rabbi,
revered wherever a Jewish heart beats, whether
in Asia or in Africa or in Europe, through whom
the light of Eastern learning, which, by the
dispersion of the illustrious teachers, and by the
final closing of the great schools, seemed to have
been extinguished forever, suddenly rose again
in the West in renewed and undiminished
splendor, is he really lost in pious meditations?
We have our suspicions, and may God pardon us
if we suspect him wrongfully.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"There are moments when silence, prolonged and unbroken,</div>
<div class="line">More expressive may be than all words ever spoken,</div>
<div class="line">It is when the heart has an instinct of what</div>
<div class="line">In the heart of another is passing."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It may be, he recalls the day of his departure
from Sura, in company with his young and beautiful
wife, and his little son, and three other young
and eminent rabbis, Rabbi <i>Sahamaria ben
Elchanan</i>, Rabbi <i>Chuschiel</i> and Rabbi <i>Nathan
ben Isaac Kohen</i>, for the purpose of raising funds
for the academy at Sura, which was then in its
last throes. He is recalling, perhaps, the harrowing
scene when they were taken captive along
the Italian coast by the Spanish-Moorish pirate,
Admiral <i>Ibn Rumachis</i>. His quivering lips and
wrinkled brow and his suppressed cry of anguish
betray his thinking of the evil designs which the
pirate admiral carried in his foul heart against
his young and beautiful wife; how she, the pious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and innocent, preferring death to infamy, had
asked him, concealing the motive: whether there
is resurrection for those who perish in the sea;
and how he, unsuspecting, answered in the
affirmative, basing it upon Psalm lxviii: 23. "The
Lord said, I will bring again from Bashon, <i>I will
bring again from the depths of the sea</i>," how she,
no sooner had the answer been given, plunged
into the sea, and the raging billows swallowed his
young and beautiful wife, the mother of his young
and only child.</p>

<p>Hence, his wrinkled brow and quivering lip and
melancholy expression on the blessed Sabbath
eve. No illuminated home awaits him. No wife
that has cheerfully labored all day long to prepare
for the festive reception of the Sabbath. No wife
to greet him with her cheery smile, and with her
wise and pure and holy converse to dispel the
cares and worries of the week. No mother to
press his child against her love-beating bosom
and call him, too, "My own sweet child."</p>

<p>His thoughts continue in their wandering. He
recalls the day when he was sold as slave to
Cordova; how he was ransomed by the Jewish
community, though his quality and learning were
unknown; how he entered, one day, the school
for Talmud studies, over which Rabbi <i>Nathan</i>,
"Dayan" of the Jews of Cordova, presided; how
he, ashamed of his costume of sackcloth, seated
himself in a corner, at a respectful distance from
the disciples; how he, aroused, at last, by the
false decisions of the ignorant Rabbi Nathan,
forgetting in his excitement his humble state, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
his costume of sackcloth, ventured to correct,
with becoming modesty, the decisions rendered;
how all eyes had turned towards the poor slave;
how, to draw forth his learning, Rabbi Nathan
entered into a debate with him, in which he
evinced such profound scholarship that Rabbi
Nathan exclaimed with enthusiastic admiration.</p>

<p>"I am no longer Head of this School&mdash;Yon
slave in sackcloth is my master, and I his disciple."</p>

<p>His mind continues in its reveries. He recalls
how he had been installed by acclamation as
Head of the Jewish community; how he had
gained the favor of Chasdai and of the Caliph;
how his great school was founded and is flourishing
now, and is the most famous in the Jewish
literary world.</p>

<p>His face becomes more and more placid. He
recognizes the finger of God in his fate. His
capture, and that of his three colleagues, he sees
now, has been providential. They had been
destined to carry the knowledge from the schools
of Babylon to Africa and Europe. His colleagues
had fared equally as well. Rabbi <i>Sahamaria ben
Elchanan</i> had been sold as a slave to Alexandria,
where he, too, was ransomed by the Jewish community,
and later he also established a flourishing
school at "<i>Misr</i>" (Kahira). Rabbi <i>Chuschiel</i>
met with the same fate. He was sold to <i>Kairuan</i>,
on the coast of Africa, and there he, too, opened
a school. Rabbi <i>Nathan ben Isaac Kohen</i> was
sold to <i>Narbonne</i>, France, and, as if fate had so
ordered it, he too opened a flourishing school at
that place. He would have continued his reveries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
had not the "<i>Sh'liach Hazibur</i>" aroused him, who
leaves his side, and mounting the "<i>Almemor</i>,"
takes his place at his desk. The services are to
begin, and so we, too, must cease our observations,
and unite with our co-religionists in their
joyous and reverential greeting of the weekly
Sabbath, the blessed Day of Rest.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />

A SABBATH EVE IN CORDOVA<br />

(CONTINUED.)</h2>

<p>THE EVENING SERVICE.&mdash;A BEAUTIFUL CUSTOM IN ISRAEL.&mdash;HONORED
WITH AN INVITATION TO CHASDAI'S HOUSE.&mdash;ILLUMINATED
STREETS.&mdash;THE TWO ANGELS.&mdash;AN IDEAL SABBATH IN
AN IDEAL HOME.&mdash;THE PRAISE OF THE VIRTUOUS
WOMAN.&mdash;A FATHER'S BLESSING.&mdash;PRESENTED
TO THE LADIES.&mdash;THE EVENING MEAL.&mdash;THE
JEWISH KINGDOM OF THE
KHOZARS.</p>


<p class="p2">The "<i>Sh'liach Hazibur</i>," (Reader) has taken
his position before the lecturn upon the "<i>Bimah</i>."
From a voluminous parchment folio he chants the
beautiful and joyous Psalms xcv, xcix, cii, in that
fascinating musical <i>recitative</i>, peculiar to Hebrew
liturgy, so joyous and yet so holy, so gay and
yet so reverential, so intensely sacred, so religiously
elevating as to lift the worshiper on its
mighty pinions, gently, from week-day life into
the higher and purer Sabbath realm.</p>

<p>The "Reader" and the congregation sing
alternate verses. What a grand chorus of human
voices! What majestic strains wing their heaven-ward
flight! How sublime a music to hear these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
hundreds of men entune their sacred anthems to
God. Sweet is the sound of the melting harp
and of the warbling lute, but sweeter than both
is the music that rises from the warm human
breast. Touching are the strains of the nightingale
and the lark, but sublimest and most
touching of all is the sacred music that rises from
the innermost depths of the strong and masculine
heart. Such</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Music religious heat inspires,</div>
<div class="line">It wakes the soul and lifts it high</div>
<div class="line">And wings it with sublime desires,</div>
<div class="line">And fits it to bespeak the Deity."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To hear a man weep, to see his strong bosom
melt in tears and his great grief express itself in
eloquent sobs, breaks another's heart, to hear
him sing with fervor and devotion the praises of
God, gives the strongest stay to the human soul.
When men sincerely sing religious songs their
hearts speak. When we hear the Elders in front,
yon saintly patriarchs, laureled with the silver
crown of three and four and five score years,
mingle their voices with those of the young in
the religious songs, we know such songs raise
their weary souls above mortal weakness, soften
their pain to ease, stay the ruthless hand of fell
disease, and force death itself to sheathe, yet
awhile, his unsparing scythe, and our lips involuntarily
breathe forth the benediction: Praised
be Thou, O God, who hast blessed us with the
gift of song.</p>

<p>The congregation rises and the "Reader"
chants aloud the <i>Borchu</i>, the appeal to the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>gregation
"to worship God, the Worship deserving,"
to which they answer: "Yea, we will
worship God, for deserving of praise is He, now
and evermore."</p>

<p>They resume their seats and continue their
prayers. They render thanks for the genial hour
of twilight, which bids the weary laborer cease,
and takes him to his peaceful home, and rewards
him there with shelter and with rest. They
render thanks for the revealed truths and doctrines
conducive to moral good and human excellence,
and sincerely they pray, that, as long as
in their thoughts and deeds God's word is their
law, and that law their light, they may never be
without his fatherly care. Again they rise; amidst
awe-inspiring solemnity, the "Reader" chants
Israel's great creed: "<i>Hear, O Israel, the Eternal,
our God is One</i>," to which the worshipers respond
in one grand chorus: "Praised be the name of
His glorious kingdom forever and aye."</p>

<p>Silent, but fervent, devotion ensues. They
express their deathless faith in the God of their
fathers, in Him who sustains life, supports the
falling, heals the sick, takes to himself the souls
of the departed, crowns the week with the blessed
Sabbath day, and they conclude praying that
God may keep their tongues from evil, their lips
from uttering deceit, and arm them with meekness
against ill will, that he may impart humility in
their soul and faith in their heart; that He may
be their support when grief silences their voice
and comfort them when woe bends their spirit,
that truth may illuminate their path and wisdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
be their guide; that He may frustrate every evil
device and turn to goodness the hearts of those
who devise them.</p>

<p>The "Reader" breaks the silence by taking a
goblet of wine, and with it, as the symbol of joy,
he entunes the <i>Kiddush</i>, the consecration of the
Sabbath as a day of rest and joy and spiritual
elevation.</p>

<p>The mourners and those who commemorate
the anniversary of the death of some dear departed,
rise now and recite the <i>Kaddish</i>, the
"Mourner's Prayer," by which they utter even in
their painful trials, their pious submission to God's
will and to His superior wisdom.</p>

<p>How sublime this mourner's service! How
consoling to those who mourn and weep, to those
who have mourned and wept, and how instructive
to those who are destined to mourn and weep!
It is as fraught with goodly lessons for those
whom the hand of death has spared as for those
who have been afflicted. It is more potent to
move the heart than are the most fervent prayers,
more eloquent than the most stirring discourses.
Would you have your family life the sweetest,
the purest, the most blessed, while it lasts, then
go to the synagogue, hear the Mourner's <i>Kaddish</i>,
and think how that heart must feel that has seen
one of its links, neglected while living, go down
into the lonely grave, there, where all the acts of
charity and kindness, where the choicest of flowers
and most expensive of monuments can cheer the
silent sleeper no more. Would you have help to
overcome jealousy and hatred, contempt and evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
thoughts and evil deeds, go to the synagogue,
hear the solemn "Kaddish," learn from it that
there is a time when regret and repentance come
too late to be heard, a time when sobbing and
wailing can not pierce the clods. Would you
moderate your ambitions and check your appetites,
would you see the frailty of the mortal, would
you keep your heartstrings vibrating in sympathy
with suffering humanity, would you have a clear
conception of the ends and aims of life, would you
keep your conscience pure, then go to the synagogue,
see the mourners rise, and from their
sighs and tears learn the lesson that for the proud
and the humble, the high and the low, the learned
and the ignorant, the rich and the poor, the tyrant
and the slave, the king and the servant there is
but one common goal, death equalizes them all,
his scythe knows no caste, no creed, no name, no
fame, no title and no rank.</p>

<p>But we have strayed from the living to the
dead, from the joyous to the sorrowful. Let us
return to the service.</p>

<p>Again the congregation rises and solemnly they
read the "Olenu," the concluding prayer, in which
they express their fervent hope to behold soon
the splendor of God's majesty, such as will call
unbelief to vanish from the earth, will banish
wickedness forever, will lead all mortals to recognize
and worship the One and Only God, and
bring on that glorious day when all men will live
together in unity and brotherly peace, and the
spirit of enlightenment will reign supreme over
all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Another joyous Sabbath hymn and the services
are concluded.</p>

<p>In the vestibule, in the meantime, a number of
strangers, showing by their appearance and costume
to belong to different countries and to different
stations of life, had gathered. They awaited
there the conclusion of the services to be invited
home for the Sabbath meal, for it is considered
a sin in Israel if a brother in faith, be he rich or
poor, friend or stranger, passes, or is permitted
to pass, the joyous Sabbath Eve by himself, alone
and forsaken, and it is regarded an act of piety to
grace the festive board of the Sabbath meal with
the presence of strangers. And so the company
of these strangers is pressingly solicited, and the
invitation is cheerfully accepted. Moses ben
Chanoch, the Rabbi, and Jacob ben Eleasar, the
special messenger, who had on that day returned
from the Jewish kingdom of the Khozars, and we,
who were cordially greeted after we were presented
by our friend Dunash ben Labrat, are the
guests of the distinguished "Nasi."</p>

<p>Through whatever streets we pass, the houses
inhabited by Jews vie in their brightness with the
brilliant illumination of the streets. A bright
and cheery home on the Sabbath Eve is a law
unto the Jew. "From the house that is cheerfully
illuminated on the Sabbath great minds will issue"<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
spoke the Talmud, and it said still more:
"When the Israelite leaves the synagogue for his
home, on the Sabbath Eve, an Angel of Good
and an Angel of Evil accompany him. If, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
entering his home, he finds the table spread, the
Sabbath lamp lighted, and his wife and children
attired in festive garments, ready to receive him,
and in unison with him to bless the Holy Day of
Rest, the Good Angel sweetly speaks: "Thy
next Sabbath, and all the Sabbaths shall be as
bright and as happy as this. Peace unto this
dwelling forever," to which the Angel of Evil says
a reluctant "Amen." But if no preparations have
been made to greet the Sabbath, if light, and
song, and thanksgiving do not cheer the inmates
of the house, then the Angel of Evil exultingly
speaks: "May thy next Sabbath and all thy Sabbaths
be as this. Gloom, misery, dissension, unhappiness
unto this dwelling forever," to which
the Angel of Good, bathed in tears, stammers
forth a reluctant "Amen."<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Upon entering the palatial residence, the very
atmosphere breathes holiness and peace. Scarcely
has Chasdai ben Isaac crossed his threshhold,
when, in accordance with the established custom
in Israel, in a joyous but sacred melody, in which
his mother, and wife, and children join, they sing
the salute to the Sabbath angels at the domestic
hearth, repeating each verse three times. Thus
it runs:</p>

<p>"Peace unto you, ye angels of God, ye high
messenger from the King of Kings, praised be
He."</p>

<p>"May your coming be in peace, ye angels of
God, ye high messengers from the King of Kings,
praised be He."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bless us with peace, ye angels of God, ye high
messengers from the King of Kings, praised be
He."</p>

<p>"Let your parting be in peace, ye angels of
God, ye high messengers from the King of Kings,
praised be He."</p>

<p>Then fondly taking his mother by his right
hand and his wife by his left, and leading them
both lovingly to the center of the room beneath
the radiant glow of the hallowed Sabbath lamp,
he sings the last twenty-one verses of the last
chapter of the Book of Proverbs, that noblest of
all noble tributes to the virtuous woman, which
reads as follows: "The heart of the husband of
the virtuous woman doth safely trust in her, so
that he shall not want for gain. She will do him
good and not harm, all the days of her life. She
seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh with diligent
hands. She is like the merchant ships; she
bringeth her food from afar. She riseth also
while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household,
and the day's work to her maidens. She
considereth a field and buyeth it. With her fruit
of her hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth
her loins with strength and maketh strong her
arms. She sees that her trading yields good
profit; her lamp is kept burning by night. She
layeth her hands on the spindle, and her hands
hold the distaff. She stretcheth out her hands to
the poor, yea, she reacheth out her hands to the
needy. She is not afraid of the snow for her
household, for all her children are clothed with
scarlet wool. She maketh herself robes, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
clothing is silk and purple. Her husband is
known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
elders of the land. She maketh fine linen and
selleth it, and delivers girdles unto the merchants.
Strength and honor are her clothing, and she
smiles at days to come. She openeth her mouth
with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of
kindness. She looketh well to the ordering of
her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
Her sons rise up and praise her, her husband
also, and he extols her. Many daughters
have done virtuously, but thou excelleth them all.
Gracefulness is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but
a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be
praised. Give her the honor that the fruits of her
hands deserve; her works are the praise of all in
the gates."</p>

<p>The scene of that happy group, Chasdai, the
learned and sagacious minister of the Moorish
realm, facing his wife and mother, and encircled
by his children, singing this glorious tribute to
the virtuous women&mdash;a weekly tribute that has
done much toward establishing the beauty and
grandeur of the Jewish family life&mdash;the wife,
whose beautiful form and features and grace
express nobility of character and godliness within,
as she lowers her black and musing eyes, as her
bosom heaves with tender emotion, and her
countenance is mantled with the scarlet hue of
innocence at her husband's enumeration of her
praises; the queenly mother, majestic and tall as
her son, and in her beauty a rival to his beautiful
wife, as she holds her eye with speaking pride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
upon her distinguished son; that scene is for the
artist's brush and for the sculptor's chisel. It is
too beautiful, too pathetic, too sublime for the
feeble tongue or pen.</p>

<p>The children crowd to their father, and kissing
them fondly, he lays his hands in blessing upon
them. Verily, blessed is the head upon which
parents' hands lie in blessing, and blessed are the
parents' hands that lie in blessing upon a child's
head. We know now whence to trace the cause
of Chasdai's greatness and nobility of mind and
excellence of character. That happy home life
reveals to us the secret of his success. Here is
the perennial fountain whence he quaffs daily the
sweet draughts of moral goodness and human
excellence. Here is that earthly paradise where
kindness and good will, and peace, love, joy,
reverence, mingle and produce continuous ecstatic
bliss.</p>

<p>We are presented to the ladies and a hearty
welcome is written on their countenance. We
are no stranger to them, for Dunash ben Labrat
has kindly announced us in advance, and they
are pleased with our presence, for they, too, are
longing to hear of the entrance of the Jews into
Europe, especially of the entrance into Spain.
We are shown our places at the festive board. A
servant pours water on our hands from a basin
and ewer. Chasdai rises, and filling a goblet
with wine, he repeats, in melodious strains, the
"Kiddush," the ceremony we had already seen in
the synagogue, the consecration of the Sabbath
as a day of rest and joy and spiritual elevation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
within the sacred precints of the home. From
beneath a beautifully embroidered cloth he takes
the Sabbath loaf, recites the benediction, and
breaking it, gives a piece thereof to every diner.
And now the meal begins, spiced with excellent
conversation, in which the women enter as lively
as the men, and more than once their profound
knowledge and brilliancy of mind and subtle wit
exact from us expressions of admiration. The
chief topic of the conversation is concerning the
Jewish kingdom of the Khozars, from whom Jacob
ben Eleazar had brought the anxiously-awaited
news that morning. What we gather from this
conversation is this:</p>

<p>West of the Caspian Sea is a powerful kingdom,
named "Khozar," before the strength of which
the Persian monarchy trembles, and whose favor
and alliance is courted by the Greek Empire.
Its original inhabitants were a Turcoman tribe,
who had gradually abandoned their nomadic habits
and maintained considerable commerce. Their
capitol, Bilangiar, is situated at the mouth of the
Volga, and a line of cities stretches across from
thence to the Don. Merchants of all religions,
Christians, Mohammedans and Jews, were freely
admitted, and their superior intelligence over his
more barbarous subjects had induced one of their
kings, Bulan (740 A. C.), to embrace the religion
of the Jews. His choice between the conflicting
claims of Christianity, Mohammedanism and
Judaism was decided in this manner: He examined
the different teachers apart. He asked the
Christians if Judaism was not better than Moham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>medanism.
To which the Christians replied affirmatively.
He asked the Mohammedan teachers
if Judaism was not better than Christianity. To
which they, too, replied in the affirmative. Both
deciding in favor of Judaism, the king embraced
the faith of Moses, and induced learned Jewish
teachers to settle in his domains. A belief in
Judaism is the necessary condition on the accession
to the throne. The most liberal toleration
of all other forms of faith prevails. But of this
Jewish kingdom nothing was known in Spain till
Chasdai learned of its existence through the
ambassadors of the Byzantian emperor. Chasdai,
to assure himself fully of the sovereignty possessed
by his brethren, had sent Jacob ben
Eleazar as a messenger to them, with a letter to
their king, which concluded thus: "Were I sure
of the existence of this kingdom I would throw
aside all my present honors and positions, and,
hastening to it, would throw myself at the feet of
a Jewish king and feast my heart and eyes at the
sight of his might and splendor." That very day
had brought the eagerly looked-for letter from
the present King of the Khozars. Chagan Joseph,
giving the above information, and concluding
thus: "I, too, am desirous of knowing thee and
of profiting by thy wisdom. Could my desire be
gratified, and could I speak to thee face to face,
thou wouldst be to me as a father, and I thy son,
and into thy hand would I intrust the government
of my kingdom."</p>

<p>The meal was finished and grace was said.
Dunash ben Labrat, mindful of the promise he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
had made to Abdallah ben Xamri to bring him
whenever Chasdai would relate to us the history
of the entrance of the Jews into Spain, had come
with his Moorish colleague, and they are announced.
Chasdai leads the way to the library,
and we follow.</p>

THE ENTRANCE OF THE JEWS INTO

INTO EUROPE.&mdash;THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM.&mdash;A TERRIBLE

BUT NOT FORSAKEN.</p>


<p class="p2">When we were comfortably seated in the magnificent
library of Chasdai ben Isaac, which was
furnished luxuriantly, and with an eye to ease
and comfort, and stocked with thousands of
parchment folios, which stood row upon row,
from floor to ceiling, in beautifully arched and
decorated alcoves, along the walls of the spacious
library hall, our host, Chasdai ben Isaac, began:</p>

<p>"My friends, you asked for an account of 'The
Entrance of the Jews into Europe.' The task you
honor me with is not an easy one. Upon these
shelves stand side by side the best that has been
written upon History, Theology and Science, the
classics, old and new, in their various tongues,
both in prose and poetry, all that has been writ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>ten
for and against the religions of Mohammedanism
and Christianity and Judaism, and yet
among these thousands of volumes you will search
in vain for historic traces of the movements of the
Hebrew people since their exile from their native
soil. Nay, more, you may even look through
the vast library of the Caliph, than which exists
at present (950 A. C.) none greater upon the face
of the earth, and still you will find naught upon
this subject. You may consult the most renowned
scholars of our age and meet with no better result.</p>

<p>You marvel why so little is known of the
History of the Jews during the period that extends
from the <i>Diaspore</i> (70 A. C.) to the time of the
conquests of the Arab-Moors of Spain, yet you
will cease to marvel when you reflect upon the
degradations, persecutions, cruelties, sufferings
heaped upon them, when you remember that
histories are never written of those who are considered
outcasts, pariahs, moral lepers, the
accursed by God and man, and the so degraded
and execrated, the so persecuted and so barbarously
treated are not over-zealous to rejoice their
scourgers by flaunting the history of their suffering
in their face. What I know of that period is
little, and that little have I secured only after
much labor and diligent research.</p>

<p>Insatiable Rome, she who had made the world
her slave, in whose realm the sun ne'er set, and
who, to vaunt of so vast a power, had killed in
cold blood, and for no offense at all, fully as
many as she ever claimed among the living had
stretched at last her cruel hand against Pales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>tine,
and the "separate" and "peculiar" and sacred
land became a heathen heritage. Jerusalem, the
Holy City, lay in ruins. Smoking embers marked
the site where stood the Temple of Temples, and
the glory of Israel fell, and fell forever, and Israel
ceased, and ceased forever, as a nation among the
nations of the earth.</p>

<p>Rome enacted a carnage within the holy city,
the like of which her inhuman legions, with all
their multitudinous and murderous experience,
had never seen before. What the famine had
left the sword consumed, and what escaped the
sword fell a prey to the flames, and what remained,
after streams of human blood had quenched the
flames, dropped dead beneath the pestilence, and
they, that had defied all these grim allies of cruel
death, were driven into an open space, the tallest
and most handsome were reserved to grace the
triumphal march of <i>Titus</i>, to be dragged along
the streets of Rome with a halter around their
neck, and to be executed after the eyes and ears
of the Romans had had their fill of the conquered's
sufferings; of the rest, all above seventeen years
of age were sold to distant countries, to the most
cruel servitude, or they were distributed among
the provinces to give sport to the people by their
gladiatorial combats, fighting for their lives
against hungry and ferocious beasts.</p>

<p>One million one hundred and ten thousand
Jews perished during this siege; ninety-seven
thousand were driven in chains as slaves to distant
lands. The old and feeble, and the young
and helpless who were spared, not from mercy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
but because the Romans for once, weary of their
slaughter, and sickened from the loathsome sight
and insufferable stench that arose from the heaps
of unburied, putrid bodies, were forced to retreat.
This pitiable remnant was compelled to take the
staff of exile.</p>

<p>Forth they went from their native soil to roam
the wide world over. Everywhere homeless,
friendless, despised, trodden down, hunted down
by man and beast, tortured, an object of derision,
a shadow of their former greatness.</p>

<p>And when occasionally a ray of tolerance found
its way to these outcast people, and under the
spell of its genial warmth the degraded dog was
metamorphosed again into a human being, and
the Jewish mind awoke again into life, and the
Jew, strengthened and rejuvenated and encouraged,
dared to enter again into the arena of useful
activity, that single ray was at once recalled
by priests, who were more cunning and contriving
than humane and godly, for only upon the
suffering of the mother-religion could the daughter-religion
expect to exist. It was feared that the
prosperity of Judaism would prove the absurdity
of Christianity's and Islam's claims and prophecies.
If the Jews are permitted to prosper and
flourish and follow their religion, and that religion
is shown to be full of life and vigor, what reason
for existence have the daughter-religions? Success
and prosperity must accompany only that religion
which the masses are to accept and follow, and
for which superiority is claimed over the others.
Such was their sophistical and self-interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
reasoning, and so they afflicted and tortured the
Jews, denied them every human right, and then
kindly and magnanimously credited God with
their own wickedness, claiming that God visited
these punishments upon the Jews for their rejection
of Christ or Mohammed. Hence, the uninterrupted
persecutions and sufferings of the Jews.</p>

<p>But God had not withdrawn his guiding hand
from His Chosen People. He had cast them
down, but he forsook them not. Never before
had they been so nigh unto extinction, and still
they despaired not. With David they said: 'Yea,
though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy
rod and thy staff shall comfort me.'<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> They lost
not their faith in God and in their divine mission.
They doubted not that there was a meaning to
their sudden change of fortune. They believed
that as each seed when sown must endure darkness
and suffer decay before it can multiply its
kind a hundredfold, so had God scattered the
children of Israel as seeds among the nations of
the earth, and subjected them to threats and sufferings
that the number of true believers might
increase a thousandfold. They regarded it a
special distinction to be chosen by God to spread
monotheism and civilization among the children
of men.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>"This strong faith in the superior wisdom of
God's doing was the elixir that preserved them
during their indescribable sufferings. This it was
that established unconsciously a bond of union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
among them, scattered though they were, and
whithersoever they went, however near to or
however far from the land where once stood the
cradle of their nation, their temple and palaces,
where ruled and sang and spoke their princes and
bards and inspired orators of deathless fame,
however removed from this dearly beloved center,
one past and one future, one hope and one aim,
characterized them all and planted within them
the seeds of indestructibility.</p>

<p>What wonder then that soon after this terrible
national calamity, a disaster from which no
other people on the face of the earth could have
possibly survived, we hear of large Jewish communities
in Asia, Africa and Europe? Some of
these were established even before the dissolution
of the Jewish kingdom. At the time of
Titus numerous Jewish communities existed in
the countries bordering on the Euphrates and the
Tigris, in Asia Minor on the north coast of Africa,
in Greece and in Italy. The Jewish community
in Rome was large and influential long before the
reign of Titus, having been brought thither as
slaves by <i>Pompey</i>, after his conquest of Jerusalem.
After the terrible siege of Jerusalem, crowds of
exiles wandered to them and swelled their number,
and these destitute exiles must have diminished
the community's opulence and respectability
and popularity, for before the <i>Diaspore</i>
Latin authors speak of them as a wealthy and respected
community; after this period, the notices
of them by <i>Juvenal</i> and <i>Martial</i> are contemptuous,
and imply that many of them were in the
lowest state of penury, the outcasts of society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever city in Asia Minor and Greece the
Apostle Paul enters he seems to find a synagogue.
In some of these cities the Jews seem to have
flourished; in most of them, however, they were
proscribed as an odious people, and were objects
of hatred and abhorrence. The rule seemed to
be, in localities where Christianity predominated
the Jews suffered; where the Heathens were
in power the Jewish communities flourished.</p>

<p>In Italy they were permitted, with few exceptions,
to live in peace. Even though <i>Theoderic</i>
wrote: "Why should we give them peace in this
life, when God will not give them peace in the
life to come?" and even though <i>Cassiodorus</i>
piously bestowed upon them the flattering appellations
of "scorpions, wild asses, dogs," etc., it never
came to very serious persecutions, and the valiant
defense of <i>Naples</i> by the Jews against the great
<i>Belisarius</i>, for which History gives them
their deserved credit, clearly shows how the Jew
can be patriotic for his adopted fatherland.</p>

<p>Concerning the Jews in Western Europe, we
have no knowledge before the second century.
When the Franks and Burgundians conquered
the Roman colonies in Gaul, the Jews, who had
been brought thither as slaves, were classed by
the victors, as Romans, and shared equal fate with
them. They were permitted to follow agricultural
pursuits and trades. Their own ships furrowed
the ocean. Jewish physicians were sought by
the princes of the Church and of the Realm. As
soldiers they distinguished themselves in the warfare
between Clovis and Theoderic. Their reli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>gious
practices were not interfered with, the Jew
was everywhere respected by the heathen.</p>

<p>But the sun of their prosperity was extinguished
when the heathen kings adopted Christianity.
With the change of their religion came a change
of heart; the heart that was formerly full of love
toward the Jew, turned into stone. The clergy
dictated, and the kings and the people obeyed
with the sword, and the Jews bled and suffered
and perished by the thousands, or were dragged
under tortures to baptism into the alone-saving
and all-loving church.</p>

<p>So much for the early history of the Jews in
France. We now come to the history of the
Jews in Spain. That theme is vast. It demands
a chapter for itself.</p>

<p class="p2">The week had passed. It was Sabbath Eve
once more. Again we assembled in the library
hall of Chasdai ben Isaac to listen to the narrative
of "The Entrance of the Jews into Spain."
When all were gathered Chasdai began and
spoke as follows: History is more communicative
about the entrance of the Jews into Spain
than she is about their entrance into any of the
other West European countries. The Bible gives
us sufficient basis to build upon the fairly reliable
theory that as early as the time of King Solomon
(1,000 B. C.) the Iberian peninsula was known
to the Israelites, that considerable traffic was
carried on between them and the autochtones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the Southwestern corner of Europe, and that a
settlement of a Jewish colony within the sunny
lands of Andalusia may have taken place then.
We have a tradition which tells us, that when in
the early days of the Christian era the Jews of
Spain were attacked for having crucified Jesus,
they claimed that neither they nor their fathers
had any share in the crucifixion, that they were
the descendants of Jews who lived in Spain long
before the time of Christ, and produced a gravestone
upon which was inscribed: "This is the
grave of Adonirams, the servant of Solomon the
king, who came hither to collect the tribute for
the king."</p>

<p>We know that when the Romans became complete
masters of Spain in the second century B.
C. they found a considerable number of Israelites
domiciled there. About 60 A. C. the Jewish
community of Spain must have been strong and
influential enough to make the coming of the
Apostle Paul among them necessary.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Crowds of exiles wandered westward and
swelled their number after the terrible siege
of Jerusalem by Titus, and in addition 80,000
slaves are said to have been transferred thither
and sold as slaves and speedily ransomed by their
more fortunate brethren. Historic sources are
agreed that these Jewish inhabitants of Spain by
their passionate fondness for agricultural pursuits,
a passion which they had brought along from the
Holy Land, soon made Andalusia the garden
spot of Europe, and by their industry, frugality,
skill in traffic and intellectual powers, they became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the pillars of the country's prosperity and acquired
great wealth and distinction.</p>

<p>It could not have been otherwise. In habits,
aims and ambitions there was an organic difference
between the Jews and their warlike fellow
citizens. The Romans, as well as the Visigoths,
were wedded to military life. Every other calling
or pursuit was degrading in their eyes. Trading
or tilling the soil was in their eyes only befitting
the slave. The uncertainty of their future,
their roaming life, their habit of living from plunder,
developed in them traits that were just the
opposite to those of the Jews. The Jew hated
war. His love for home was intense. His industry
and frugality, his religious life and his love
of study, were proverbial, and so in proportion as
the others increased in brutality and ignorance, in
poverty and moral corruption, the Jews reached
the heights of prosperity, morality and intellect.</p>

<p>That prosperity, however, proved to be their
curse. It is a mistake to believe that the greatest
crime of the Jews was their faith; it was their
prosperity. Idlers and spendthrifts have never
yet been thrilled with ecstatic delight at another's
prosperity, and never is their venom more poisonous
and their wrath more bitter than when the
Jew is unfortunate enough to be fortunate. In
Spain, as elsewhere, a mighty power of soldiers,
and monks, and priests, and dependants, all unproductive
laborers, stood arrayed against the
handful of Jews, the only productive laborers of
the realm, and the battle cry was not the Jews'
money, but the Jews' "soul." There was great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
diplomacy in this battle cry. They knew of the
intensity of the Jew's faith in his religion. They
knew how he was wedded to the traditions and
hopes of his race. They knew that he would
cheerfully part with all his treasures rather than
sacrifice an iota of his belief. They knew that
the industrial, and economical, and intellectual,
and peace and home-loving traits of the Jew were
so deeply rooted, that he would at once begin
anew to acquire again, perhaps for the same end,
all that had been cruelly torn from him, just as
the bees, nothing daunted by the theft of their
painfully hoarded wealth, will start anew to fill the
hive. And so, whenever they had need of the
money of the Jews, and that need was, alas, a
frequent one, they became all at once painfully
concerned about the Jewish soul, and its final fate,
and they never failed to relieve the Jews of their
treasures, even if they failed in the saving of their
souls.</p>

<p>Spain took the lead in Jewish persecutions and
maintained its odious distinction for centuries.
Henceforth there is no lack of historic material
concerning the Jews in Spain. But, alas! until
the time of the conquest of Spain by the Moors,
it is not a history of achievement, it is a history of
suffering&mdash;a martyrology. That martyrology
began with the Third Council of Toledo (589 A. C.)
at which Recaredo presented his abjuration of
Arianism and was anointed as the first Catholic
monarch of Spain. At that council laws were
passed, of which the spirit may be comprehended
from the following preamble and titles:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Laws concerning the promulgation and ratification
of statutes against Jewish wickedness, and
for the general extirpation of Jewish errors.
That the Jews may not celebrate the Passover
according to their usage; that the Jews may not
contract marriage according to their own customs;
that the Jews may not practice the Abrahamitic
rite; that the Jews bring no actions against Christians;
that the Jews be not permitted to bear witness
against Christians."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Jews knew what was wanted; they paid
a large sum of money, and the laws remained inoperative
till Recaredo's successor, Sisebuto, ascended
the throne. This king entered into a
league with Emperor Heraclius, with the pious
determination of "extirpating the dangerous race
throughout the world," and so he issued a law
which gave the Jews a year's time to decide
whether they would confess Christ and be
baptized, or be shaved and scourged, their property
confiscated, and themselves forced to leave
the country.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Ninety thousand are said to have submitted to
baptism, but with them the enforced Christian
rite was but a mask for their secret Jewish belief
and practices. And they had ample cause for regretting
their religious weakness, for baptism did
not secure them from new indignities and humiliation.
They were despised for their apostacy, and
their property was taken from them as if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
had not complied with the king's edict. Thousands
upon thousands fled to the northern coasts
of Africa, and with them fled the prosperity from
the Gothic kingdom.</p>

<p>Having once discovered so excellent a source
for satisfying their greed for money, they had no
intention of letting such golden opportunities
escape them. A few years had passed, and the
baptized Jews, true to their industrial and
economical habits, had hoarded up some wealth
with which they might buy life from the infuriated
mob, and so the Fourth Council met at Toledo,
in the year 633, and enacted the cruel requirement
that the children of those, who had accepted
Christianity, should be torn, forever, from their
parent's heart, to be educated by Christians in the
Christian faith. The Sixth Council enacted a law,
that every king on his accession shall take an
oath, that he will execute all the laws against the
Jews, and will issue others equally as severe.
Another law enacted the punishment of death
upon Christians, who should embrace Judaism, or
commit "the monstrous and unutterable crime of
pursuing an execrable commerce with the ungodly."
The Ninth Council decreed, that all
baptized Jews were bound to appear in the church,
not only on Christian, but also on Jewish holidays,
lest, while they outwardly profess Christianity,
they should practice secretly Judaism.</p>

<p>The Twelfth Council, of Toledo, 681, far surpassed
its predecessors in the cruelties of its enactments.
The preamble complained that "the crafty
Jews had eluded all former laws," and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
decreed that hereafter 100 lashes would be inflicted
upon the naked body, and after that, the offender
would be put in chains, banished, and his
property confiscated for any of the following offences:
For rejecting the sacrament of the
Lord's Supper, for not bringing children or servants
or dependants to baptism, for observing the
Passover, the New Moon, the Feast of Tabernacles,
for violating the Christian Sabbath, or the
great festivals of the church. The circumcision
of a child brought additional tortures, upon the
father mutilation, upon the mother the loss of
her nose. No marriage was hereafter to be contracted,
without solemn obligation that both would
become Christians. All subjects of the kingdom
who harbored, assisted or concealed the flight of a
Jew, were to be scourged, and have their property
confiscated. The Jew who read or allowed
his children to read books written against
Christianity was to suffer 100 lashes; on the
second offense the lashes were to be repeated,
with banishment and confiscation. No Jew was
to hold any office by which he might have authority
over Christians.</p>

<p>I shall spare you a recital of the numerous
other cruel laws enacted, and the account of
the terrible sufferings endured. The land re-echoed
the piteous groans and lamentations of
the lashed and scourged. Their wealth purchased
but temporary immunity and exemption.</p>

<p>"Certainly the heroism of the defenders of every
other creed fades into insignificance before this
martyr people, who confronted all the evils that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the fiercest fanaticism could devise, enduring
obloquy and spoliation and the violation
of the dearest ties, and the infliction of the most
hideous sufferings, rather than abandon their faith.
For these were no ascetic monks, dead to all the
hopes and passions of life, but were men who
appreciated intensely the worldly advantages they
relinquished, and whose affections had become all
the more lively on account of the narrow circle in
which they were confined. Enthusiasm and the
strange phenomena of ecstasy, which have exercised
so large an influence in the history of
persecution, which have nerved so many martyrs
with superhuman courage, and have deadened or
destroyed the anguish of so many fearful tortures,
were here almost unknown. Persecution came to
the Jewish nation in its most horrible forms, yet
surrounded by every circumstance of petty annoyance
that could destroy its grandeur, and it
continued for centuries their abiding portion.
But above all this the genius of that wonderful
people rose supreme. While those around them
were grovelling in the darkness of besotted ignorance;
while juggling miracles and lying relics
were the themes on which almost all Europe was
expatiating; while the intellect of Christendom,
enthralled by countless superstitions, had sunk
into a deadly torpor, in which all love of enquiry
and all search for truth were abandoned, the Jews
were still pursuing the path of knowledge, amassing
learning, and stimulating progress with the
same unflinching constancy that they manifested
in their faith."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The enemy succeeded in impoverishing the
Jew, and in stifling his energies and efforts for
the good of the country, but failed ignominiously
in their effort to inspire him with a love for
Christianity, which perhaps was never sincerely
wanted, and, if wanted, the means chosen to
secure the end were not such that are crowned
with success. The degraded and tortured Jew
was filled with a bitter hatred against Christianity,
and with a burning longing for revenge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And vengeance came. God had heard the wailings
and seen the sufferings of the people that
never was born to die. The Gothic kingdom of
Spain was to suffer bitterly for its terrible crimes
and the Jew was to be rewarded a thousandfold
for the sufferings he had endured for his
religion's sake. Weaker and weaker became
that kingdom which the Jews had made in former
years the pride of Europe. It was beset by
foes within and by foes without. The tyranny of
the church and of the throne had instigated dissatisfaction
among the grandees of the state, and
the insult of Roderick, the king, to Florinda, the
young and beautiful daughter of Count Ilyan
aroused this bravest of Spanish warriors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
numerous powerful friends of his into open rebellion.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer drew the Arab-Moors.
They reached the Northwestern point of Africa,
where the Jews, who had fled and who had been
banished thither, and who had risen there
to power and influence, greeted them with a
hearty welcome. The martial sound of the Moslem
hosts made as pleasant music to their ears as to
the insulted father and his wrath-inspired followers.
Both parties conspired with the Moorish
chief, Amir Musa Ibn Nosseyr, for the invasion
of Spain. Musa grasped eagerly at this ardently
wished-for opportunity. He dispatched his valiant
warrior Tarik, with 12,000 men across the narrow
strait that separated Africa from Europe, and
Islam from Christianity. Roderik met him at the
banks of the Guadalete with an army eight times
as large, and that day was the last Spain beheld
him and his army. On that day Christianity
ceased to rule within the land of Spain, and as its
power sank, there dawned once more the sun of
prosperity unto Israel.</p>

<p>The Moors did not forget the valuable services
of the Jews. The early hatred against them in
Arabia, for refusing to accept the creed of
Mohammed, had long since been converted into
tolerance and good will. Unlike the religion of
Christianity, which started as the religion of love
and soon became the religion of the sword,
Islamism began as the religion of the sword but
soon become the religion of love. Political and
religious freedom and social recognition was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
granted to the Jew throughout the caliphate, and
from that day unto this the two Oriental people
have lived in peace side by side upon the Occidental
soil, viewing with each other in their
noble efforts to restore unto Spain her original
beauty and prosperity, and to make her in culture
and art and intelligence the mistress of Europe.
We, sons of Israel, have labored hard and zealously
in this noble contest, but with all our efforts
our rival has passed beyond us, and humbly we
cede the palm of victory to the Arab-Moors."</p>

<p>Here Chasdai ben Isaac ceased. He had
spoken of the sufferings of the Jews with such
perceptible anguish, he had related the part which
the Jews took in the conquest of Spain with such
vivid animation, and referred to the prosperity of
the Jews under Moorish sway, and to Moorish
tolerance and intellectual greatness, with such
touching pathos that when he paused, a deep impressive
silence ensued. At length Abdallah ben
Xamri, the Moorish poet laureate to Caliph
Abder Rahman III., arose, advanced towards
Chasdai, and bowing low, thus he spoke:</p>

<p>"Your modesty must not bridle my tongue. I
would appear an ingrate to my people should it become
known that I listened in silence to your last
remarks. The Arab-Moors forgot not their
benefactors, nor are they so boastful as to arrogate
to themselves, or allow others to bestow
upon them a superiority which is unmerited.</p>

<p>Within our heart of hearts we treasure the
services which your people have rendered.
We owe the Hebrew people much more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
your modesty, noble Chasdai, has suffered you to
claim. You opened the portals of Spain unto
us, and to you alone belongs the credit of turning
Spain once again into a paradise, for a hundred
years of uninterrupted warfare under the banner
of Islam, had unfitted us for agricultural and
mechanical and intellectual and artistic pursuits.
You sowed the seeds of our prosperity. We sat
at the feet of your masters, and if we have proven
ourselves apt scholars, we bear testimony to the
excellency of your teachers. Far be it from us
to claim superiority over our honored rival. In
the arts and sciences and philosophies your people
hold distinguished places. Your theologians
have given us many a problem which the wisest
among us have failed to solve. In the purity of
your home and social life, and in your industries
you serve the world as models. In poetry I
should never venture to compete for supremacy
with friend Dunash ben Labrat and Menachem ben
Saruk. In diplomacy, where lives the man who
can equal you in intellect and sagacity, to
whom else do we owe our political greatness
than to you, Chasdai ben Isaac, the Jewish
minister of our beloved Caliph Abder Rahman
III."</p>

THEIR POSITION IN MEDICAL SCIENCE.</h2>

<p>THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.&mdash;A CHANGE IN THE FORTUNES OF THE JEWS
AND MOORS.&mdash;AN EXAMINATION INTO THEIR GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS.&mdash;THEIR
SKILL IN MEDICAL SCIENCE.&mdash;MIRACLE CURE BY CHRISTIAN
CLERGY.&mdash;JEWISH BODY PHYSICIANS HIGHLY PRIZED
AND MUCH SOUGHT.&mdash;PROMINENT MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND
EMINENT PHYSICIANS.&mdash;RASHI.&mdash;IBN EZRA.&mdash;IBN TIBBON.&mdash;MAIMONIDES.&mdash;AVENZOAR AVACENNA.</p>

<p class="p2">We have witnessed the rise of Islam. We accompanied
the Arab on his march of conquest.
Breathlessly we stood upon the banks of the
Guadalete and awaited the issue of a battle upon
which the destiny of nations depended. We
followed the triumphal processions of the Arab-Moors
into Spain, and our eyes and hearts never
ceased rejoicing over the manifold beauties and
wonders which Moorish skill spread o'er fair
Andalusia, and our tongues ne'er tired speaking
of the manifold blessings which Moorish social
and domestic and political life and religious tolerance
showered lavishly not only upon their own
generation, but upon all the generations that have
been ever since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
And there was another picture, not so beautiful,
but far more instructive; not so cheering, but
fuller of pathos. Tearfully we witnessed the siege
of Jerusalem and its unparalleled massacre. Heartbroken
we followed the despised and spurned
and abused, the friendless and homeless Jew,
in his vain efforts to find a spot where he might
rest his weary head in peace. Our hearts leaped
for joy when we beheld the followers of Mohammed&mdash;not
the followers of the founder of the religion
of love&mdash;not only restore to the Jew human
rights unjustly torn from him, but also offer him
the hand of brotherhood. When we parted last
we left the Jew and Moor busily engaged in
making fair Andalusia, in culture and art and intelligence,
the mistress of the world. Then all
was peace and joy and sunshine.</p>

<p>We have returned. Five centuries have passed
since our last visit. We are now at the end
of the fifteenth century. A mighty change has
taken place. Peace has turned to war, joy to
sorrow, sunshine to darkness. Culture wears the
crown of thorns. Art is dragged through the
mire. Science is fettered hand and foot. Religious
liberty sends forth piteous shrieks from the
flames and smoke of the auto-da-fe. Enlightened
Europe weeps and trembles. We ask Mercy:
"Why weepest thou?" And she sobs forth the
name: "Cardinal Ximenes." We ask Art the
same question, and she stammers forth: "The
Church." Science answers: "The Inquisition."
Religious Liberty utters between its death throes
the name: "Torquemada." Enlightened Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
weeps and trembles, because the vast storehouses
of learning, which Moorish and Jewish intelligence
had built up, are about to be consigned to the
flames, and the builders themselves are to be extirpated
from the soil, upon which they have lived
nigh unto eight centuries, and which their own
diligent toil has made the wonder of Europe.</p>

<p>"Haste ye," the Spirit of knowledge calleth unto
us, "the furnaces are heated, the death-pyres are
awaiting impatiently their martyrs, the ships are
ready in the harbor to carry off, and give abundance
of water to all such who refused the few
drops of the water of salvation, the massive gates
of the Inquisition dungeons are open, and the instruments
of torture are eager for their cruel and
inhuman work of death. Haste ye, the moments
are precious, gather the knowledge for which you
have come, as speedily as you can; tarry, and not
a trace nor a record will remain of this most wondrous
and fruitful era of Europe's intellectual advance."</p>

<p>Let us heed the warning, and hasten to our
task. We had come prepared for a detailed account,
but now we must content ourselves with a
mere synoptical sketch of the progress made by
the Arabs and Jews in literature, art, philosophy
and in the mathematical and physical and applied
sciences, during the same era when the rest
of Europe was yet lying in comparative darkness
and barbarism.</p>

<p>A feeling of awe comes over us as we approach
our task. We cannot but feel that in dealing
with the Arab and Jew in Europe, the period that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
extends from the beginning of the eighth to the
end of the fifteenth century, we are dealing with
a divine agency, sent into Europe to rekindle and
keep alive the sacred fire of intelligence, which,
prior to their coming, had been extinguished by
the church and by barbarian conquerors. At
this era they are the sole depositories of learning.
The second and third chapters of this narrative
have acquainted us with the terrible stifling mist
of ignorance and its concomitants, fanaticism and
cruelty and corruption and intense suffering,
which hovered over Europe at the time when the
people of the Orient had entered it, and began
their intellectual unfolding.</p>

<p>In the East those centers of learning that had
not yet passed away were rapidly declining. Antioch,
Alexandria, Bagdad, Damascus, Jerusalem,
these cities which in their day had made the light
of the East more luminous with their light, had
drawn in their rays and sent them forth no more.
But the Jew and Arab had wandered into Europe
before this intellectual decline, and there they
fanned the spark of knowledge they had brought
with them into such a brilliant and active life, that
its light still illumines our mind, and its genial
warmth still cheers our heart. The Jew and the
Moor have made Europe their everlasting debtor
for their services in bridging the yawning chasm
which separates ancient from modern culture.
With them, most of that ancient knowledge,
for which mankind had toiled diligently and untiringly
for thousands of years, would have been
lost, and lost forever, and modern knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
would have been compelled to begin again at the
very alphabet, and we to-day might have been
some 2,000 or 3,000 years behind. Without their
untiring efforts to disperse the poisonous mists,
and force their light upon the people, even at the
expense of much suffering, the darkest, and most
slothful period of European annals which was
co-eval with the highest Jewish and Moorish intelligence
before that intelligence made itself felt in
Europe, might have still surrounded us to-day.</p>

<p>But this is not the time for reflection nor laudation.
Hark! Already the doleful knell is tolling,
and the people are thronging the public square,
and the clergy are chanting hymns of victory and
imprecatory formula, and the <i>autos-da-fe</i> are piled
up high and dry, and the condemned are impatient,
for they long for death, they pray to be
released, at last, from the insufferable tortures of
the Inquisition, and so we must hasten to our task
of recording upon History's pages the wonderful
strides the Jews and Moors did make in science
and literature and philosophy, before flame and
sword and rack and expulsion, silence their voice
and obliterate their works forever.</p>

<p>We shall consider their intellectual labors in the
order of their importance and service to human-kind,
and for that reason we shall begin with a
hasty review of their progress in medical science.
In this branch the Jew was without peer. He excelled
the Moor, because the restrictions which Islamism
imposed upon the follower of the Koran, such as
prohibitions against dissecting man or animal, did
not trammel him. And he eclipsed the Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>tian,
for the Church held medical science accursed,
branded and condemned the physician as an atheist,
and zealously propagated the doctrines that cures
must be wrought by relics of martyrs and bones
of saints; by prayer and intercession; that each
region of the body was under special spiritual
charge, the first joint of the right thumb being in
care of God the father, the second under that of
the blessed Virgin, and so on to the other parts.
For each disease there was a saint. A man with
sore eyes must invoke St. Clara. St. Anthony is
a sure cure for other inflammations, St. Pernel
delivers from ague. In all cases, cured or not,
the clergy constituted themselves as the self-appointed
agents for collecting the fees for the
saints, and as long as this spiritual method of
curing disease formed one of their most productive
sources of gain, they took great care that
no other mode of treatment should excel theirs.
Hence their attitude against physicians, and their
frequent council decrees, making it a crime punishable
with death for a Jewish physician to attend
a Christian patient, and for a Christian patient to
seek recourse to a Jewish physician, instead of to
the shrines and altars of the saints.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But for all
that, Jewish physicians, and Jewish medical
schools flourished, and found their prohibited
profession very profitable among the Christians,
especially among kings, and popes, and princes,
and bishops, among the very men, who passed
the sentence of death for crimes which they were
the first to perpetrate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>In the tenth and eleventh and twelfth centuries,
nearly all the physicians in Europe were Jews.
Later, the Moors joined them, but only for a
short time, and then the Jews again became the
sole champions of medical science. There was
not a man of power or prominence who had not
his own Jewish body physician, and these body
physicians constituted a power, for besides holding
the lives of potentates in their hand, they
combined with their professional skill, all the
learning of the age, a profound knowledge of
theology, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy,
music, law, statesmanship, poetry, lexicography,
criticism, and of other branches.</p>

<p>In naming them and their schools and their
works we must give honorable mention to the
Jewish physicians of France. Out of the Spanish
peninsula there had came across the Pyrenees an
intellectual influence which found a warm reception
by the Jews of France. To verify this, of
schools, we need but name the famous medical
school at Narbonne under the presidency of
Rabbi Abbu, and the flourishing school at Arles,
and the most famous of them all, the college of
Montpellier, with the great Profatius as regent of
the faculty, as distinguished in medicine as he
was eminent in astronomy; and of the distinguished
Jewish physician of France, we need but
name Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac, (1040-1105)
better known under the abbreviation: "Rashi,"
the greatest French physician of the eleventh
century, unrivaled in his age for his instructions
in great surgical operations, as the Cæsarean sec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>tion;
nor must we forget the learned Ibn Tibbon,
(1160-1230) who emphasized the necessity of a
close study of botany for medical purposes, and
of carefully cultivating the art of preparing drugs.</p>

<p>The scope of this discourse will not permit
us to name all of the distinguished Jewish physicians
of Spain, nor to enumerate their works
nor to dwell upon their merits. From the many
we shall select the name of Ibn Ezra, (1093-1107)
the polyhistor of his age. His chief work
is a treatise on practical and theoretical medicine,
entitled, "Book of Proofs."</p>

<p>But greater than Ibn Ezra, both as a physician
and a philosopher, is Moses Maimonides, (1135-1204),
honored by his countrymen with the titles:
"The Doctor," "The Great Sage," "The Glory
of the West," "The Light of the East, Second
Only to Moses." He was the most famous of all
living physicians of his time. He was coveted
as body physician by the greatest potentates, and
the justly celebrated Sultan Saladin considered
himself honored and fortunate to secure him as
his body physician. When Richard C&oelig;ur de
Lion, King of England, fell sick, Moses Maimonides
was summoned for consultation. His contributions
to medical works are many. He wrote
medical aphorisms derived from former Greek,
Latin, Hebrew and Arabic sources; an abridgment
of Galen, a treatise on "Hemorrhoids," on
"Poisons and Antidotes," on "Asthma," on "The
Preservation of Health," on "The Bites of Venomous
Animals," and other valuable works.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>We return to the Moors, and here, too, we are
confronted by an abundance of medical literature.
Over 300 distinguished medical writers are
mentioned, and their works are voluminous.
Chief among them stands Avenzoar, Ibn Zohr,
(beginning of the Twelfth century) physician, to
the court of Seville. His famous work "Canon
of Medicine," an encyclopedia of medical knowledge,
established for him a world wide reputation
and became the medical authority for European
universities for many centuries. Upwards
of 100 other medical treaties are ascribed to him,
some are tracts of a few pages, others are works
extending through several volumes. Avicenna
(Ibn Sina, 980-1037) occupies an honored place
next to him. Chief among his works is his
"Method of Preparing Medicine and Diet,"
"Treatment of Leprosy," and two works on
"Fever," in which he continues the work begun a
century before by the Jewish physician, Isaac ben
Suleiman Israeli. The Moors themselves acknowledge
that the Jews far surpass them in their
knowledge of anatomy, physiology and hygiene,
that from want of knowledge of the construction
of the human body, their surgery is necessarily
crude. Their great fame, however, rests, and
will rest, upon their introduction of pharmacy,
their therapeutical use of drugs, their making
chemistry, the handmaid of medical treatment.
Pharmacopoeia dates from this period. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Moors of Spain, opened the first apothecary
shops, and many of the names and many of the
medicines still used, have come down to us from
their period.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> We must content ourselves with
this brief review (more the scope of this work will
not permit,) of "The Position of the Jew and the
Moor in Medical Science."</p>

<p>MARVELOUS INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY OF MOORS AND JEWS.&mdash;MOORS

REFUTATIONS BY THE CHRISTIAN CLERGY.&mdash;THEIR

<p class="p2">We turn next in our review of the intellectual
labors of the Moors and Jews in Spain, during
the period that extends from the beginning of
the eighth to the end of the fifteenth century, to
an examination of their position in the sciences.
The deplorably benighted state of contemporaneous
Europe prepares us to expect little or
nothing in this noblest department of human
knowledge, and our surprise is therefore so much
the greater as we gaze upon, and ponder over,
the mighty strides made by the Moors and by the
Jews on the highways of science. The impetus
in this special branch seemed to have come from
the Arabs. The few words of Ali, the fourth
Arabian caliph: "Eminence in science is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
highest honor; he dies not who gives life to learning,"
seems to have taken as deep roots within
the minds of the Arabians, and to have yielded
far more precious fruits, than did the Koran the
vast volume of his distinguished father-in-law;
Mohammed.</p>

<p>For centuries the Arab-Moors led the world in
this department. Here the Jews cannot lay claim
to rivalry; they were collaborators, but nothing
more. In justice to the Jews, however, we shall
add, that there are some who differ from us in
our conclusion. Some give to the Jews an equal
rank with the Moors, others claim that the point
under discussion is still debatable. And we must
not treat their objection lightly. We must not
forget that in treating of these scientists of Spain,
we are dealing with men known under Arabic
names; beyond a knowledge of their scientific
works we know little or nothing about them.
Concerning their religion, history maintains a
commendable silence; the Mohammedans preferring,
at this period, the ink of science to
the blood of martyrs. Knowing of the scientific
scholars nothing more than that their works
are written in Arabic, and that their names
are Arabic, the canons of criticism will not permit
us to conclude that a scientist who writes
in Arabic, and whose name is Arabic, is necessarily
also a Mohammedan by faith. The records
give incontestable proof that many and many of
the distinguished Jewish scholars of that period
wrote in Arabic, and went under an Arabic name,
who, but for a chance article of work from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
pen upon a Hebrew subject, might have been
classed to-day as Arab-Moors by race and
Mohammedan by creed. Be this as it may.
That point will never be definitely settled, and as
long as a doubt remains, the Arab-Moors may
justly claim the benefit of the doubt, and the Jews
shall be the last to contest their claims of superiority
in the sciences during the Middle Ages
over every other race or creed.</p>

<p>Entering upon our subject, and beginning at
the root of the tree of science, we make the pleasing
discovery that to the Arab-Moors of Spain
belongs the honor of having been the first to
generally introduce in Europe, for scientific and
industrial and commercial purposes, the science
of arithmetic. Had they achieved nothing else,
the introduction of this most needful of all the
branches of mathematics alone, would have entitled
them to a distinguished place among the
world's benefactors. That introduction was the
starting point of a new progress. Its use and
development made possible the higher mathematics
and analytical mechanics and astronomy,
and every other science discovered since, and hailed
with delight. Little do we think to-day when
we pride ourselves on the startling achievements
of our astronomers and meteorologists and
other scientists, when we speak of the miracles
they work in space and time, of the ascensions
they make to the remotest of the nebulæ, and of
their holding communion there with stars and
worlds and solar systems whose light has not yet
reached the earth, little do we think when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
speak of electricity obeying our every wish, and
of steam yoked in our service, and of the countless
other wonders of modern science, little do we
think that for all these blessings we are lastingly
indebted to the Arab-Moors, and to their assistants,
the Jews, for their faithful labors in mathematics.
Little do we think that we are pronouncing
Arabic words when we speak of the "zero"
or the "cipher", the "naught,"&mdash;that most important
of all figures, upon which the most needful
of all arithmetical contrivances is based&mdash;the
decimal system. And when we remember that
the prosperity and progress of every country in
Europe dates from the introduction of the Arabian
figures<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and when we realize the clumsiness and
uselessness of the Hebrew and Greek and Latin
alphabet figures, in vogue in Europe before the
entrance of the Arab-Moors into Spain, and when
we try to work out a problem of multiplication,
say ninety-nine multiplied by ninety-nine, in accordance
with the notation of the Arabic nine
digits and cipher, and then, in accordance with
the Roman alphabet figures, XCIX times XCIX,
then, perhaps, will we most readily give thankful
praise to those to whom Europe owes so
magnificent a boon&mdash;to those who, with so simple
an invention, opened the avenues of prosperity
and loosened the fetters that had shackled the
advance of science.</p>

<p>Encouraged by their success in arithmetic, they
turned towards a higher branch of mathematics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and gave to Europe the science of numbers and
quantity, and named it algebra ("al'jabara," to
bind parts together). Whether, as some claim,
the Arab-Moors obtained their knowledge of
algebra from their schools in Bagdad or Damascus,
who, in their turn, had derived it from the
Hindoos, or whether, as others claim, the Jews,
in their diligent translations from the early Greek
geometricians into Arabic, must have come across,
and followed up the algebraic trace, which is supposed
to exist in the treatise of Diaphantus (350
A. C.), or whether the Moorish claim be the true
one, that the honor of having invented algebra
belongs to one of their own mathematicians, who
flourished about the middle of the ninth century,
to Mohammed ben Musa, or Moses,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
whoever the inventors be of this valuable branch
of mathematics, unanimity of opinion prevails
concerning one point, and that is, the Arab-Moors
and Jews first introduced algebra into Europe.
Still more Ibn Musa (or Ben Moses) developed it
to the solution of quadratic equations, and Ibn
Ibrahim (Ben Abraham) to the solution of cubic
equations, Ibn Korrah (or Ben Korah) to the
application of algebra to geometry, laying thus
the foundation of analytical geometry. Geometry
led them to trigonometry, which they elevated
to a practical science by substituting sines for
chords and by establishing formulas and tables of
tangents and cotangents and secants and cose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>cants.
From trigonometry Al Baghadadi advanced
to land surveying, and wrote on it a treatise
so excellent, that by some it has been declared
to be a copy of Euclid's lost work on that
subject.</p>

<p>The unbiased student, who searches diligently
among the achievements of the Moors and Jews,
will soon detect, not only a systematic contrivance
on the part of the literature of Europe to
put out of sight our obligations to them in science,
but a bold effort, wherever a chance presents
itself, to wrest their hard toil from them, and bestow
it upon some one, who is not so unfortunate
as to be Saracen or Jew. But "injustice founded
on religious rancor and national conceit cannot
be perpetuated forever." The real truth can not
be much longer hidden, and if the chapters
of this volume have no other effect than
simply to do justice to the memory of those who
have toiled and who have suffered, that we
may enjoy, to-day, the blessings of our civilization,
we shall regard our labors amply rewarded.</p>

<p>We have digressed. Let us return to our
theme. They toiled for science sake, not for
fame. They looked for none. When Spain itself,
indebted to them for all her blessings, repays so
miserably their faithful services, why should they
look to Europe for recognition? "High minds,"
it has been truly said, "are as little affected by such
unworthy returns for services, as the sun is by
those fogs which the earth throws up between
herself and his light."<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>And so, expecting no thanks, and working for
none, they advanced, with their present achievements
as stepping stones, to the study of astronomy.
And marvelous, almost incredible, is their
success in this department. They determine the
altitude of celestial bodies by means of the astrolabe.
They register all the stars in their heaven,
giving to those of the first magnitudes the names
they still bear on our celestial maps and globes,
writing thus indelibly their impress upon the celestial
heaven, though it be denied them in the
literature of Europe. They give us the words
"azimuth," "zenith," "nadir," "almanac," and others.
They compute time by the oscillations of
the pendulum, and determine the true length of
the year. They discover the theory of the refraction
of light and ascertain the curvilinear path of
a ray of light through the air. They explain the
horizontal sun and moon, and why we see those
bodies before they have risen and after they have
set. They measure the height of the atmosphere
and determine it to be nearly fifty-eight and one
half miles. They give the true theory of the twilight,
and of the twinkling of the stars. They not
only know the spheroidal form of the earth, but
approximately its diameter and circumference.
Averroes discovers the spots upon the sun. Kepler
alludes honorably to the observations of Levi
ben Gerson, and Copernicus to those of Profiat
Duran, and Laplace accepts Ibn Musa's proof of
the diminution of the eccentricity of the earth's
orbit, and Ibn Junis' proof of the obliquity of the
ecliptic. They invent the first pendulum clock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
They build the first observatory in Europe, the
Giralda, (1196 A. C.) turned into a belfry after
the expulsion of the Moors and Jews. They
almost discover the laws of gravity, considering
it terrestrial, reserving it for Newton to teach that
it is universal. Rabbi Isaac ben Sid prepares for
Alphonso X., king of Castile, new astronomical
tables, for which Alphonso takes the credit, names
them the Alphonsine tables, and is modest enough
to remark: "That if God had called him (the
king) into His councils when He created the universe,
things would have been in a better and
simpler order."</p>

<p>The Church, in the meanwhile, does her best
to refute the "ungodly scientific teachings" of the
Moors and Jews. The argument of the "Sohar"
that the earth revolves upon its own axis and
around the sun (a Jewish teaching in the twelfth
century, anticipating that of Copernicus), the
shining lights of the church nail to the ground
with clinchers from the Bible such as these: "The
sun runneth about from one end of the heaven to
the other," and "the foundations of the earth are
so firmly fixed that they cannot be moved."
The absurdity of the existence of the antipodes
they prove to their full satisfaction in this manner:
"It is impossible that any inhabitants exist
on the opposite side of the earth, since no such
race is recorded by Scriptures among the descendants
of Adam." Again, "we are told by St. Paul
that all men are made to live '<i>upon</i> the face of
the earth,' from which it clearly follows that they
can not live upon more faces than one or upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the back." Again, "how could men exist on the
other side of the earth, since on the day of judgment,
being on the other side, they could not see
the Lord ascending through the air?" Ergo, the
teachings of the Church alone are the true theories
of this universe, "concerning which it is not
lawful for a Christian to doubt."</p>

<p>But the Moors and Jews treated with contempt
this puerile opposition, little thinking that the
Church of "Love unto all men" has stronger and
more convincing weapons than tongue and pen to
prove her points. They persevered in their path so
well begun. They turned to the physical sciences.
They originated chemistry. They discovered
some of the most important reagents, such as the
nitric, sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, and alcohol,
which still bears its Arabic name. They
knew the chemical affinities of gold, silver, copper,
iron, tin, lead and quicksilver. They invented
various apparatus for distillation, sublimation,
fusion, filtration, etc. They constructed
tables of specific gravities. In geology, Abu
Othman wrote a valuable work. In zoology, the
following extract from a chapter of Avicenna
(Ibn Sinai or Ben Sinai) on the origin of the
mountains, which reads as if it were written by
one of the most advanced geologists of our
day, will best indicate the heights to which they
attained in this science. "Mountains" said
Ibn Sinai (980-1037), "may be due to two different
causes. Either they are upheavals of the
crust of the earth, such as might occur during a
violent earthquake, or they are the effects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
water, which, cutting for itself a new route, has
denuded the valleys, the strata being of different
kinds&mdash;some soft, some hard. The winds and
waters disintegrate the one, but leave the other
intact. That water has been the
main cause of these facts is proved by the existence
of fossil remains of aquatic and other animals
on many mountains."<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>But little has been cited here concerning
the position of the Moors and Jews in the
sciences. The field is too vast and the scope of
this volume will not permit us to enter into
greater details. He that would have fuller
knowledge upon this theme let him peruse the
following works, to which I am largely indebted
for the facts stated above. "Geschichte der Arabischen
Aerzte and Naturforscher," Wuestenfeld;
"Conquest of Spain," "Book V.," by Coppe;
"Eastern Caliphate," Stanislaus Guyard; "History
of Algebra," Phillip Kelland; "History of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Arithmetic," George McArthur; "Astronomy,"
R. A. Proctor; "The Intellectual Development of
Europe," Draper; "Conflict Between Religion and
Science," Draper; "Rationalism in Europe," Lecky.</p>

<p>Yet, even though our synoptical review has
been brief we have seen and heard enough to
understand fully why in the year 1492, and within
the realm of Spain, Wisdom mourns and
Knowledge wails, and Science is broken-hearted
and Europe trembles. Anguish seizes upon our
soul at the thought, yet a little while, and all this
wondrous intellectual advance, so active and so
promising will be torn off the soil of Europe, root
and all, and darkness, cruel darkness, ignorance,
cruel ignorance, will ascend the throne once
more and usher into the scenes of life stagnation,
corruption, suffering, despair.</p>

<p>For science and for humanity's sake we venture
to approach the princes of the realm and
prelates of the church and plead for mercy. "No!"
is the stern reply of Ferdinand and Isabella,
"Spain is polluted by the presence of the accursed
Moors and Jews." "Avaunt!" shouts Cardinal
Ximenes, "Catholicism is in danger where Moorish
and Jewish brain is at work." "Mercy ye
ask for," fairly shrieks the Grand Inquisitor Torquemada,
"the Church knows no mercy for the
Moorish and Jewish infidel dogs. Begone, or
their fate is yours."</p>

<p>We are not yet prepared for death. Our task
is not yet done. Many a Moorish and Jewish
achievement remains still to be spoken of, and so
we shall hasten our review, while yet we may
speak of their position in literature.</p>

IN LITERATURE.</h2>



<p>SPAIN'S PROSPERITY STIMULATES LITERATURE.&mdash;LAVISH PROVISIONS FOR
EDUCATION.&mdash;CALIPHS PATRONS OF LEARNING.&mdash;VAST LIBRARIES

FOSTERED.&mdash;STORY-TELLING.&mdash;JEWISH AND
MOORISH POETRY CONTRASTED.&mdash;JEHUDA

<p class="p2">When we turn to an examination of the position
of the Jews and Moors of Spain in Literature,
and behold their progress in this department of
knowledge, we are not so much surprised as we
were when we surveyed the wondrous advance
both did make in the department of science, at a
time when the rest of Europe was still under the
spell of a mental torpor. The great epochs of
the world's literature have ever had their origin
during times of peace and prosperity. They may
continue into turbulent times, and even outlive
them, but never can they take root in them.
Such an age Spain and its people were enjoying
for many years under Moorish sway. The
Moors had ended their conquests, and for a while
the Jews enjoyed freedom from persecution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Peace prevailed, and prosperity gladdened the
heart of man. Hills and dales yielded bountiful
harvests. The rich mines of Spain brought to
light the treasures of the earth. The long line of
coast was crowded with vessels, which restlessly
furrowed the oceans, exchanging the products of
Europe for the wealth of the Orient. The commerce
of the world centered in Spain; there, too,
could be found its wealth. The age was ripe for
literary activity.</p>

<p>The Jews were the first to open this epoch-making
era of European literature. The past
had shown that the Jewish mind needs no other
impetus for earnest intellectual toil than an age
of peace and prosperity, and the present marked
no departure from the general rule. The Arab-Moors,
sharing the general characteristics of the
Jews, did not tarry long behind; as the Jews were
mindful of the teachings of their sages, that the
crown of learning is the greatest of honors, so
did the Moors remember the words of the great
Caliph Al Mamum: "They are the elect of God,
they are His best and most useful servants, whose
lives are devoted to the improvement of their
rational faculties." And so great was the literary
zeal of both these races that within comparatively
few years there arose a literature upon grammar,
lexicography, rhetoric, history, politics, biography,
translation, statistics, music, fiction, poetry,
law, ethics, theology, philosophy, much of which,
despite our boasting of to-day, not only need not
fear modern criticism, but is still authority.
And it endured for nearly eight centuries, ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>ceeding
in duration that of any other literature,
ancient or modern, and even after it was crushed,
it continued to emit a steady luster through the
clouds and darkness of succeeding centuries. Like
a flood it overflowed the mountain barriers and
went on, widely irrigating the arid fields of Europe.</p>

<p>The provisions for education were abundant.
To every mosque and synagogue a free school
was attached. Endowed colleges dotted the
Saracen Empire, in which free tuition was given
to all who were eager for knowledge, and stipends
were cheerfully furnished the indigent students.
In addition to this, many of the caliphs
distinguished themselves not only for their scholarly
attainments, but also for their munificent patronage
of learning. They assembled the eminent
scholars of their times, both natives and foreigners,
at their court making it the familiar resort
of men of letters, establishing a precedent
which the Medicis later turned to excellent use.
Above all, they were intent upon the acquisition
of extensive libraries. They invited illustrious
foreigners to send them their works, and munificently
recompensed them. No donation was so
grateful to them as a book. They employed
agents in Egypt, Syria, Irak and Persia, for collecting
and transcribing the rarest manuscripts;
and their vessels returned freighted with cargoes
more precious than the spices of the East. In
this way they amassed magnificent collections&mdash;that
of Alhakem Second amounted to 600,000
volumes.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Our own Harvard cannot reach half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
that number, even in the nineteenth century, and
with the advantage of steam and printing press.
Besides these royal libraries, seventy public libraries
are named in Andalusia. The collections in
the possession of individuals were sometimes
very extensive. A private doctor refused the
invitation of a sultan of Bokhara because the
transportation of his books would have required
400 camels.</p>

<p>The subjects upon which these thousands upon
thousands of volumes treat are so manifold, and
the authors so numerous&mdash;the department of history,
for instance, according to an Arabian author
cited by D'Herbelot, could boast of 1,300 writers&mdash;that
even a synoptical review of them would
need more space and time than the scope of these
discourses will allow, and so we dismiss them with
the simple remark that such is their excellence,
such the influence they exercised upon the literature
of Europe that a careful perusal of the works
still extant in the original or in translation will
well repay the special student of any of the special
branches of literature of which they treat.</p>

<p>The poetry of that period, however, refuses to
be dismissed. She bids us halt. She, the queen
of literature, is not accustomed to such slight.
She was born to rule, she brooks no opposition,
and so we pause. And after we have held sweet
converse with her minstrel bards, and after we
have perused a number of the almost countless
volumes devoted to winged words of music and
to poetic fancy, we regret not, that she made us
pause. No longer do we think her boast an idle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
one that Spain, during the period that extends
from the eighth to the fifteenth century, can show
a greater number of poets than all the other nations
combined. We need not ask the reason
why. Any one acquainted with the extraordinary
richness of both the Hebrew and its kindred&mdash;the
Arabic language&mdash;their natural cadence,
which lends itself to verse, the ease which both
languages afford in passing from prose to poetry,
and with the bent of mind of both races, poetical,
delighting in figurative speech, in metaphor and
allegory and fable, in luxuriant imagery and fanciful
romance, any one acquainted with their
Oriental predilection for the fairer sex, which
could only express itself in languishing idyls or
passionate lyric sonnets, any one knowing all
this, will not wonder at the vastness of the Jewish
and Moorish poetic literature.</p>

<p>The Moors excelled in what was then known
as the art of "story telling." They had brought it
with them from the East and the enchanting moonlight
evenings of Andalusia, and the sequestered,
fairy-like gardens, with their shady cypress trees,
and their cascades, and their flowering shrubs,
and their bowers of roses, and their crypt-like
grottoes, all these tended to keep the love for their
art alive. With them "this story telling," both
in prose and poetry, took the place of theatrical
representation. Those of you familiar with one
of the many extant prose collections of stories
such as "The Arabian Nights," can readily form
an opinion of the great charm that branch of literature
must have had in the original language
for the Moorish people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Physicians often ordered "story telling" as a
prescription for their patients, to mitigate their
sufferings, to calm their agitation and to give
sleep after protracted insomnia, or to beguile the
<i>ennui</i> of the grandees, or to recreate them after
their fatigues. The "munshids" or "story tellers"
found their vocation a very honored and a very
profitable one, and they took great pains to foster
that art.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These stories and their lyric poetry exercised
a potent influence over the literature of Southern
and Western Europe. It can be traced in the
reproduction of many stories as well as in the
structure of the French "<i>fabliaux</i>" and "<i>chansons
de geste</i>" of the "<i>jongleuers</i>", "<i>trouveres</i>" of the
North; and is more particularly to be observed in
"<i>le gai saber</i>" of Provencal troubadours. It extended
into Italy, and is found in the charming stanzas
of Ariosto, and in the "twice told tales" of Boccaccio's
"Decameron."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a word, the entire fiction and poetry of
Southern Europe, up to the Renaissance, owes
as much to the Spanish-Arabians for matter and
form, as it does to the Latin language.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Still
more, when we remember that our English Chaucer
borrowed the scheme of his "Canterbury Tales"
from several of the stories of Boccaccio, and other
Italian writers, and that other English writers imitated
Chaucer in borrowing plots and subjects
from Italy and France and Spain, we may well
claim that the Arabian idea has penetrated into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the North, and left its profound impression upon
English literature.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>But in the purer poetry, in touching tenderness
of pathos, in sublimity of thought and majesty of
diction, in those lofty flights where hope blends
with sorrow, and with a religious fervor that is
tempered by celestial sweetness and warmth of
heart, here, the Jewish poets of Spain not only
excel their Moorish rivals, but every poet before
or since. Once more Israel's sons and daughters
took their harps of Judea from off the mourning
willows, and the Songs of Zion, the Glory of
Israel, and the Praises of the Universal Father
resounded again as sweet in the fairy land of
Andalusia, as formerly upon the banks of the Jordan.
They consecrated their Muse to the purest
and holiest purposes. The epigram of Aben Esra,
one of the immortal poets of this age, tells briefest
and best the uses to which poetry lent itself
among the various nations. He wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Among the Arabs in their fiery way,</div>
<div class="line">The song doth breathe alone of loves sweet sway.</div>
<div class="line">The Roman sings exultant of war's spoils.</div>

<div class="line">In wit and spirit doth the Greek excel,</div>
<div class="line">And India's bards of curious riddles tell,</div>
<div class="line">But songs devoted to the Maker's praise,</div>
<div class="line">The Jews alone among the nations raise."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We do not mean to convey by this, that the
Jewish poets of Spain devoted themselves only
and exclusively to the sacred song. <i>Jehuda Ha-Levi</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
thus sings of love and wine as fiery as e'er
did Moorish bard.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p class="p2">It was not for want of cause that the sedate
greybeards of Cordova applied for legal aid to
have the passionate love songs of <i>Abraham Ibn
Sahal</i> prohibited, for there was not a youth or
maiden in the city who could not repeat them by
heart. And as to songs of war and wit and spirit,
the "Makamen" of <i>Jehuda ben Salamo ben
Alchofni</i>, better known as "<i>Charisi</i>" gives ample
proof to assure us that the Jews might have
become dangerous rivals to the Roman and
Greek writers had they fostered that phase of
poetry as did these. Thus sings Charisi;</p>

<div class="line">Oh beautiful bride, what is the form of thy friend, that thou say to me, Release him, send him away?</div>

<div class="center">II.</div>

<div class="line">Hasten to the refuge of thy sister, and protect the son of Isaiah against the troops of the Ammonites.</div>
<div class="line">What art thou, O Beauty, that thou shouldst inspire love? that thy voice should ring like the voices of the bells upon the priestly garments?</div>
<div class="line">The hour wherein thou desirest my love, I shall hasten to meet thee. Softly will I drop beside thee like the dew upon Hermon.</div>

<p>And as to the curious riddles which India's
bards did tell, let us translate one or two, from
Jehuda Ha-Levi to show that even into this field
of poetic fancy the Jewish mind did wander, and it
plucked there fruit as choice as India's bards did
ever pluck. Ha-Levi asks, Who solves this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Eye it has and yet is blind,</div>

<h3>NIGHT-THOUGHTS.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Will night already spread her wings and weave</div>
<div class="line">Her dusky robes about the day's bright form,</div>
<div class="line">Boldly the sun's fair countenance displacing,</div>
<div class="line">And swathe it with her shadow in broad day?</div>
<div class="line">So a green wreath of mist enrings the moon,</div>
<div class="line">Till envious clouds do quite encompass her.</div>
<div class="line">No wind! and yet the slender stem is stirred,</div>
<div class="line">With faint, slight motion as from inward tremor.</div>
<div class="line">Mine eyes are lull of grief&mdash;who sees me, asks,</div>
<div class="line">"Oh wherefore dost thou cling unto the ground?"</div>
<div class="line">My friends discourse with sweet and soothing words:</div>
<div class="line">They all are vain, they glide above my head.</div>
<div class="line">I fain would check my tears; would fain enlarge</div>
<div class="line">Unto infinity, my heart&mdash;in vain!</div>
<div class="line">Grief presses hard my breast, therefore my tears</div>
<div class="line">Have scarcely dried, ere they again spring forth.</div>
<div class="line">For these are streams, no furnace heat may quench,</div>
<div class="line">Nebuchadnezzar's flames may dry them not.</div>
<div class="line">What is the pleasure of the day for me,</div>
<div class="line">If, in its crucible, I must renew</div>
<div class="line">Incessantly the pangs of purifying?</div>
<div class="line">Up, challenge, wrestle and o'ercome! Be strong!</div>
<div class="line">The late grapes cover all the vine with fruit.</div>
<div class="line">I am not glad, though even the lion's pride</div>
<div class="line">Content itself upon the field's poor grass.</div>
<div class="line">My spirit sinks beneath the tide, soars not</div>
<div class="line">With fluttering seamews on the moist, soft strand.</div>
<div class="line">I follow fortune not, where'er she lead.</div>
<div class="line">Lord o'er myself, I banish her, compel</div>
<div class="line">And though her clouds should rain no blessed dew,</div>
<div class="line">Though she withhold the crown, the heart's desire,</div>
<div class="line">Though all deceive, though honey change to gall,</div>
<div class="line">Still am I Lord, and will in freedom strive.</div>

<div class="line">Her wings are gemmed, and from her throat,</div>
<div class="line">When the clear sun gleams back again,</div>
<div class="line">It seems to me as though she wore</div>
<div class="line">About her neck a jeweled chain.</div>

<div class="line">Thine eloquence a mighty stream?</div>
<div class="line">Only the blameless offering</div>
<div class="line">Not the profusion man may bring,</div>

<div class="line">The long days out of minutes grow,</div>

<div class="line">So when the sinking sun draws near to night,</div>

But with all their distinguished merits in these
branches of poetic literature, they laid no claims
to recognition, nor shall we claim it for them.
Their aspiration was higher. Their lay was
sacred. Their ideal of poetic grandeur was the
writing and singing of majestic hymns, and they
have given us a hymnology, a collection of pure
and sacred songs, that has never yet been
equalled. We know not what rational religious
fervor is, we know not what real piety is, we
know not what joyful ectasy is, nor what tearful
and penitent tenderness means, we know not
what trust in, and love of God is, we know not
what it is to hear the heart speak to and of God,
and the soul sing her Maker's praise, we know
not what passionate devotion to, and deathless
love for, Israel's cause, for the memory of her
glorious past and for the hopes of her future is,
we know not what all these are and mean, until
we have read some of the hymns and sacred odes
and elegies and meditations of the Jewish poets of
Spain. Turn to your "Day of Atonement" services;
read there the inexpressibly beautiful contributions
to sacred poetic literature by Rabbi
<i>Solomon ben Jehuda Gabirol</i>, or Rabbi <i>Joseph
ben Ibn Abitur</i>, or Rabbi <i>Bechai ben Joseph</i>, or
Rabbi <i>Moses ben Esra</i>, or the greatest of them
all Rabbi <i>Jehuda ben Samuel Ha-Levi</i>, and
answer it, where have you seen and where have
you read or heard, anything that will bear comparison,
with their religious poetry? Let us see
the following from Gabirol:</p>

IN PHILOSOPHY.</h2>


<p>ALEXANDRIA, THE INTELLECTUAL METROPOLIS OF THE WORLD.&mdash;A
PRODIGIOUS STIMULUS GIVEN TO LEARNING.&mdash;THE SEPTUAGINT.&mdash;DEVELOPMENT
OF GRECIAN PHILOSOPHY INTO ARISTOTLIANISM.&mdash;THIS
ENGRAFTED ON JEWISH THEOLOGY.&mdash;OPPOSITION
OF CHRISTIANITY TO ARISTOTLIANISM.&mdash;AVERROES.&mdash;MOSES
MAIMONIDES.&mdash;OPPOSITION
UNSUCCESSFUL.</p>


<p class="p2">We must devote some little space and time to
a review of the place the Moors and the Jews
held in philosophy during their stay in Spain
from the eighth to the fifteenth century. The purpose
of this work makes this review necessary.
Not that we shall see any wonderful advance in
this department of learning, nor that we need
show the glaring contrast between the sophistical
cobwebs of the cotemporaneous scholastics
and the rational researches of the Moorish and
Jewish philosophers, but that we may see what a
debt of gratitude modern philosophy owes the
Jew and Moor, for taking up the thread of philosophical
research where Greek intelligence had
been forced to leave it, and for carrying it forward
sufficiently for modern philosophy to build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
upon it, as a superstructure, the theories and
systems of to-day.</p>

<p>To fully understand their place in philosophy
it is necessary for us to retrace our steps in history
some 2,000 years, and enter the city of
Alexandria. Here Alexander the Great had established
his seat of government. It became the
intellectual metropolis of the world. Thither the
conqueror brought the wealth and learning of the
globe. Into that city the people streamed, or
were brought as prisoners, from the remotest
corners of the known world, from the Danube to
the Nile, and from the Nile to the Ganges. For
the first time in the world's history, there could
be found in one city, men who could speak learnedly
of the Borean blasts of the countries beyond
the Black Sea, and of the simoons of the Oriental
deserts, of pyramids and obelisks and sphinxes
and hieroglyphics, of the Persian and Assyrian
and Babylonian wonders, of the Chaldean astronomers,
of hanging gardens, aqueducts, hydraulic
machinery, tunnels under the river-bed, or of the
Assyrian method of printing, on plastic clay.
For the first time in the world's history seekers
after knowledge could listen, in the Serapion of
Alexandria, to learned discussions between Jewish
monotheists and Persian dualists and Grecian
polytheists and Egyptian mysticists and Indian
Brahmanists and Buddhists, and between the
Ionics and Pythagoreans, and Eleatics and the
Atomists and Anaxagoreans, and the Socratists,
and Platonists and Aristotelians and Stoics and
Epicureans and Neo-Platonists. No age or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
city had ever furnished better opportunities for
intellectual pursuits. No city could ever before
this, point to kings more enthusiastic for the promotion
of learning than were her Ptolemys, nor
could all antiquity boast of a library equal to hers,
or of a museum as justly celebrated for its botanical
gardens and astronomical observatories and anatomical
college and chemical laboratory.</p>

<p>A prodigious stimulus was thus given to learning,
and it has left its impress upon the world's
civilization. Here Euclid wrote the theorems
which are still studied by the college students of
to day. Here Archimedes studied mathematics
under Conon. Here Eratosthones made astronomy
a science. Here Ptolemy wrote his "Syntaxes."
Here Ctesibius and Hero invented the
steam engine. Here true philosophy flourished,
and for the first time, too, in the world's history.
The people of the Orient had dabbled in speculative
thought before this, but the results achieved
showed that the Oriental mind is not adapted to
abstract reasoning. The luxurious habits and
voluptuous surroundings and tropical climate of
the Orient tend more toward poetry, music and
love and languor than toward psychical contemplations.
The awe-awakening phenomena of
nature, which confront the Oriental everywhere,
naturally lead him to accept as <i>a priori</i> principles
what the philosophers of the Occident make
the subject of endless, and for the most part, incomprehensible
and unsatisfactory systems of
philosophy.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that the great religions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of the world sprang from Oriental soil, while the
great philosophical systems took roots in Western
lands. Yet, up to this period, not even the
West, with all its labors, had sounded the depths
of true philosophy. The entire pre-Socratic philosophy
wasted its energies upon the futile effort
to find some principle for the explanation of
nature, which to the Hebrew mind had been solved
thousands of years before in the opening verse of
the Bible. One thought it to be <i>water</i>; another,
<i>air</i>; and a third an original <i>chaotic matter</i>. The
Pythagoreans declared that <i>number</i> is the essence
of all things, and the Eleatics believed they
were nearer the truth by negating all division in
space and time. The Atomists endowed each
atom with gravity and motion, and accounted
thus for the origin of all physical existences and
states. Socrates and Plato both came much
nearer to the solution of the problem; the former
postulated self-knowledge as the starting point of
all philosophy, and the latter combined all preceding
systems into one scheme, with an <i>infinitely
wise and just and powerful spirit</i> as its
guiding principle, but idealistically only. The
additional realistic view of things had not yet been
reached, and could not be reached, for that depends
upon universal and exact and scientific
knowledge, which prior to the great age of
Alexandrian learning, to which all ages and
climes and nations contributed their experiences
and observation and knowledge, had never yet
existed. Aristotle, the teacher of Alexander,
and the friend of Ptolemy, thus found through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Alexandrian influence, opportunities for philosophical
reasoning, which necessarily gave his
system an almost inestimable advantage over his
predecessors. From the study of particulars he
rose to a knowledge of universals, advancing to
them by induction. This inductive method was
grounded upon facts of his own experience and observation,
as well as those of others, whom the intellectual
metropolis had sent into Greece. He
became the first and best absolute empiricist. His
system acquired an encyclopedic character. He
became the father of logic, natural history, empirical
psychology and the science of rights.
Aristotelian philosophy became the intellectual
corner stone on which the Museum rested, and is
to-day, through Jewish and Moorish influence, as
we shall presently see, the corner stone of modern
philosophy.</p>

<p>The Jewish community of Alexandria was very
large. When Alexander founded this city and
gave it his name, he wished to secure for it permanent
success, and so he brought them thither
by the thousands. Ptolemy brought 100,000
more, after his siege of Jerusalem, and Philadelphus,
his successor, redeemed from slavery
198,000 Jews, "paying their Egyptian owners a
just money equivalent for each." Alexander's
expectations were realized; the city of his name
led the world in commerce and intellect. With
an enthusiasm almost bordering on passion the
Hebrews devoted themselves to philosophy, especially
to Aristotelian philosophy. They ingrafted
it upon their own theology and philo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>sophic
speculations, some going even so far as
to believe that Aristotle must have been a Jew
himself.</p>

<p>Henceforth Aristotelian philosophy is Jewish
philosophy. The occasional acceptance of the
Neo-Platonic mysticism, theosophy and theurgy,
was unable to obliterate it.</p>

<p>During seven centuries learning flourished in
the city of Alexandria, zealously fostered by native
Egyptian, Greek and Jew. A new power
arose&mdash;Christianity. At once it recognized in
Aristotelian philosophy an inimical foe, and began
its work of suppressing rational research and
free thought. The rest we need not relate. We
know what happens when Christianity institutes
inquisitors of faith instead of inquirers of learning.
We know what happens when Christianity
uses power instead of argument. That day,
when the beautiful and young Hypatia, perhaps,
the most accomplished woman that has ever
lived, the popular lecturer of Platonic and Aristotelian
philosophy at the Museum, where her
lecture room was crowded daily, with the wealth
and intellect of Alexandria; that day, when this
most noble of women was assaulted by Bishop
Cyril's fanatical and blood-thirsty monks, when
she was dragged by the followers of the "religion
of love," from her chariot, stripped naked in the
street, pulled into the church, where she was cut
to pieces&mdash;where her flesh was scraped from the
bones with a shell and the remnants cast into fire;
that day marked the extinction of Alexandrian
learning&mdash;it marked the extinction of Athenian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
learning. Science, so successful, died the death
of strangulation, and the expounders of Aristotelian
philosophy were silenced, and their literature
condemned to the pyre.</p>

<p>But Aristotelian philosophy was not yet dead.
The Jews still lived, and with them the works of
Aristotle. They had succeeded in concealing
translations and original copies of his works from
the fanatical champions of ignorance. They had
absorbed it into their system of thought. They
had used it in their commentaries upon their
Scriptures. They had saturated their very
prayers with it. They had sought to reconcile
Jewish theology with refined heathen philosophy.
Whither they wandered, it wandered, and where
they were permitted to study there also was Aristotelian
philosophy studied. What they had long
wished was granted them at last. They became
the restorers of philosophy in Europe. Moorish
and Spanish prosperity afforded them the opportunities
for an uninterrupted study and development
of the Aristotelian philosophy. Soon the
Moor shared their enthusiasm. The caliphs sent
special messengers to secure whatever of Aristotelian
philosophy had escaped the mob of "St.
Cyril."<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Many were they, both Jews and Moors, who
devoted themselves to this philosophy, and vast
the systems they unfolded. The wonderful ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>vance
they had made in the sciences, and in the
other branches of learning, enabled them to enlarge
upon the teachings of Aristotle. New facts
and new experiences and new observations led
them to new and advanced inductions. However
great the temptations be to enter into some analysis
of their philosophical system, we must not yield
to them; that is not the object of this review.
Our design is to show what influence Moorish
and Jewish learning exercised upon European
civilization. We have seen its impress upon the
sciences and literatures of Europe, and its impress
is visible still on modern philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> From
all parts of the world persons having a taste for
philosophy found their way to the Moorish and
Jewish sages of Spain. Gerbet himself, later
Pope Sylvester II., had repaired to Cordova and
Seville to hear Moorish and Jewish philosophers
expound the mysteries of wisdom and philosophy,
and so illustrious an example soon became the
raging fashion among European scholars. As if
desirous of dividing the honors equally, both the
Moors and the Jews sent at the same time, a representative
champion into the philosophical arena
who, by their united labors, not only demolished
scholasticism but also laid the permanent foundation
of modern philosophy. The representative
philosopher of the Moors was the great Averroes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
(Ibn Roshd, 1149-1198) whose name still occupies
an honored place upon the pages of history
of philosophy, and whose system, bearing his
name&mdash;Averroism&mdash;is still recognized among the
philosophical systems of the world. The representative
Jewish philosopher was the great
Moses Maimonides, (1135-1204) the greatest Jewish
philosopher the Jews have ever produced, and
one of the greatest the world has seen to this
day, whose philosophical system, unfolded in his
"More Nebuchim," ("Guide for the Perplexed")
still remains truly, grandly immortal.</p>

<p>For several centuries the Moorish and Jewish
philosophy was the delight of such men in whom
Spanish learning kindled a desire for deeper research
and loftier thought than Europe had hitherto
offered. Even many of the schoolmen
shared this enthusiasm. But this very enthusiasm
was the deathblow to scholasticism. Once
imbued with Moorish and Jewish empirical philosophy
and inductive reasoning, the rational
mind could no longer pursue the sophistic teachings
which the church held up as the divine wisdom.
That philosophy shook the old faith to its
very root, produced new predispositions and prepared
the way for the coming change. It weaned
men from simply believing the church's "say-so"
and taught them to think, and when men began
to think scholasticism ceased, and the Reformation
began, and with it modern thought. No
longer would the rational mind believe that legends
and miracles can decide such questions as
are the starting point of philosophic thought. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
longer would they endure the preposterous teaching&mdash;the
product of ignorance and audacity&mdash;that
the faith of the church is absolute truth; that
faith is greater than knowledge; that a thing may
be theologically true even though it be philosophically
false. No longer would they disgrace
themselves with continuing to waste time and
parchment with discussions and treatises such as
these, to which the schoolmen of several centuries
devoted hundreds of volumes: "How many
choirs of angels are there in heaven, how do
they sit and upon what instrument do they play?"
"To what temperature does the heat rise in hell?"
"Wherein lies the difference between 'consubstantiatio
and transubstantiato'?" "What kind of
feathers had the angel Gabriel in his wings?
What kind of a swallow it was that caused Tobias'
blindness? Whether Pilate washed his hands
with soap before he condemned Jesus? Whether
it was an adagio or allegro which David played
before Saul? What sort of salve it was which
Mary brought to the Lord? Whether the coat
for which the soldiers cast lots constituted the
entire raiment of the Redeemer? Whether the
valley of Jehosophat is large enough for the
world's judgment day?" and so on <i>ad nauseam</i>.
A schism arose. The indignation of St. Thomas
Aquinas, the leader of the Dominicans, knew no
bounds when he beheld Christians drinking in, in
full draughts, Moorish and Jewish philosophy.
The Franciscans opposed him and every effort of
his to suppress their writings. The conflict lasted
till 1512, when the Lateran council condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
"the abettors of these detestable doctrines to be
held as heretics and infidels," and the Dominicans,
armed with the weapons of the Inquisition, were
not slow to silence Averoism in Europe.</p>

<p>But though silenced it lived in Jewish philosophy,
and that, as little as its Talmud and Bible
no power on earth has ever been strong enough
to silence. Though silenced, with the aid of the
Jews it flashed forth to all parts of Europe, where
it found its way as readily into the "Opus Majus"
of Roger Bacon as into the curriculum of studies
of the University of Padua. Though silenced,
it permeated the Renaissance. Though silenced,
it formed the groundwork of Spinoza's system.
Though silenced, with the aid of the Jewish philosophers,
who laughed the Inquisition to scorn,
it was studied everywhere, and everywhere it
assumed those gigantic proportions destined to
illumine the intellect of Europe. Though silenced,
with the aid of the Jewish philosophy, it
ushered in modern philosophy and the civilization
of to-day.</p>

<p class="p2">Hark! Again the doleful knell is tolling. With
greater speed and in larger numbers the people
are hurrying to the public square. The procession
of priests, chanting hymns of victory and imprecatory
prayers, is starting towards the auto-da-fe.
The victims supplicate for death more piteously
than before. Hark! Again, and with greater
alarm, the agonized voice of civilization calls
unto us: Haste ye, the furnaces are heated! The
pyres are prepared! The massive gates of the
gloomy inquisition dungeons are open. The instruments
of torture are ready for the cruel work
of death. Haste ye, the moments are few, gather
whatever knowledge there still remains to be collected
concerning the wondrous achievements of
the Jew and Moor, as speedily as you can; tarry,
and flame and sword and rack and expulsion will
hurl all knowledge of it into oblivion forever!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Let us heed the warning and briefly state what
yet remains to be told. You have 'ere this surmised
what we are about to prove, the imperishable
monuments which the Moors and Jews have
erected to their name and fame in the arts and
sciences, in literature and philosophy bear witness,
not only to their great intellectual wealth, but also
to vast material possessions. Wherever learning
is zealously fostered there wealth exists, and
where wealth abounds, there agriculture and
commerce and industry must have had prior existence.</p>

<p>Thus it was in Moorish Spain. Never before,
nor ever since, did Spain enjoy a prosperity equal
to that which blessed her lands, when Moorish
and Jewish skill and diligence and enterprise made
her, in glaring contrast with the rest of Europe,
the granary and the industrial and the commercial
center of the world. We have not yet forgotten how,
when in the introductory chapters of this volume,
we thought ourselves back some eight or ten centuries
in the world's history, and hastened across
the wild Atlantic to learn of the condition of Europe
and her people, how spell-bound we stood,
as we suddenly beheld wonders and beauties
in Spain, scarcely equalled to-day in all Europe.
And when we reflected upon the present condition
of Spain, among the poorest of all European
countries, its people proverbially indolent and
ignorant, we had to assure ourselves, again and
again, that it was Spain, indeed, which suddenly
disclosed to us these unexpected, and still unequalled,
proofs of industry and learning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
cultured taste. Nor have we yet forgotten, when
gliding upon the majestic Guadalquivir along fertile
valleys, and luxuriant fields and graceful groves,
and fragrant parks, and glittering palaces, and
busy factories, and restless mines, we passed out
of Spain, and visited the other countries of Europe
how dreary and wretched and appalling the scenes
were which met our gaze everywhere. Scarcely
a city anywhere. Nothing that could, even with
the broadest stretch of leniency, be designated as
agriculture. Everywhere pathless deserts and
howling wastes, and death-exhaling swamps.
Wretched, windowless and chimneyless and floorless
hovels sheltered man and beast under the same
roof. Everywhere men with squalid beards, and
women with hair unkempt and matted with filth,
and both clothed in garments of untanned skin, that
were kept on the body till they dropped in pieces
of themselves, a loathsome mass of vermin, stench
and rags. Everywhere beans and vetches and
roots and bark of trees and horseflesh furnished
largely the means of supporting life. Nowhere
even a trace or semblance of industry. Everywhere
the word commerce an unintelligible term.
Such was the condition of the rest of Europe when
Spain was basking in the sunshine of a most
wonderful state of prosperity under the skill and
enterprise of the Jew and the Moor.</p>

<p>From the very first both directed their attention
to agriculture. The fertile valleys and the luxuriant
fields, and the vine-clad hills, and the fruitful
orchards, and the flowry meads and the sweet-scented
pasture lands of Palestine bear eloquent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
testimony to Jewish skill in agriculture. The advice
which the prophet Jeremiah had sent to the
Jewish captives of Babylon: "Build ye houses,
and dwell in them, and plant gardens and eat the
fruits of them, ... and increase in your captivity
and not diminish. Seek the welfare of the city
whither you are carried as captives, and pray unto
the Lord for it; for in the welfare thereof shall ye
prosper and have peace."<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This excellent advice
the Jews applied to themselves, and faithfully followed,
wherever they lived in exile, and wherever
they were suffered to dwell in peace and promote
the country's welfare. The Arab-Moors were no
less devoted to this noble pursuit. When their
warfare was over they beat their swords into plowshares,
and their spears into pruning knives. Their
motto was: "He who planteth and soweth, and
maketh the earth bring forth fruit for man and
beast, hath done alms that shall be reckoned to him
in heaven." These two races devoted themselves
to the cultivation of Spain with their hereditary
love for the occupation, and with the skillful application
of the experience, which they had gathered
in other lands where they had dwelled or where they
had established their power. By them agriculture in
Spain was carried to a height, which until the invention
of machinery was not surpassed in Europe.
As early as the tenth century the revenue of agriculture
of Moorish Spain alone amounted to nearly
$6,000,000, more than the entire revenue of all the
rest of Europe at that time. The ruins of their
noble works for the irrigation of the soil, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
great treaties on irrigation and crops, and improved
breeds of cattle, on grafting and gardening,
and their code of laws regulating agriculture, which
still exist, still attest their skill and industry and
put to shame the ignorance and indolence of their
Spanish successors. Many plants were introduced
in Europe, and successfully cultivated by them,
which, after the expulsion of the Jews and Moors,
and the discovery of America, Spain lost and
neglected, such as rice and sugar cane (<i>soukhar</i>),
as they called it, saffron and mulberry trees, ginger,
myrrh, bananas and dates. The Spanish names
of many plants show their origin, and some have
traveled even to us, such as the apricot, from
"<i>albaric aque</i>," the artichoke from "<i>alca chofa</i>"
cotton from "<i>al godon</i>."<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> They gave Xeres and
Malaga their celebrated wine, which has maintained
its reputation to this day.</p>

<p>The mining industries, too, were zealously
fostered by them. Spain was and is a widely
metalliferous country. Her hidden treasures were
known already to the Ph&oelig;nicians, Carthagenians
and Romans, and were mined by them with great
profit. The gold and silver of Solomon's temple
come through Hiram of Tyre from Tarshish, which
was Southern Spain. But the dark ages had set
in and with them Europe's universal sloth. When
the Moors entered Spain the ancient mines had
been, for the most part, abandoned. They revived
this industry, and with a zeal which may best
be told by the existence to-day of 5,000 Moorish
shafts&mdash;distinguished from the former by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
square instead of round&mdash;in one district (Jaen)
alone gold was found in large quantities, and it
was one of their leading articles for manufacture
and export. They gave us the Arabic word
"<i>carat</i>" which we still use in speaking of the
quality of gold. They opened the inexhaustible
vein of mercury which they worked with great
profit and with such skill, that it still forms the
largest deposit in the world, yielding still one-half
of the quicksilver now in use, and being a government
monopoly, this one remnant of Moorish
and Jewish skill and industry, alone, still produces
an annual revenue of $1,250,000. In addition to
these, lead, copper, iron, alum, red and yellow ochre
were mined in great quantity. Precious stones
also were in great abundance&mdash;the beryl, ruby,
golden marcasite, agates, garnets. Pearls were
found on the coast near Barcelona. Building
stones, marbles, and jaspers of all colors, were uninterruptedly
quarried in the mountains.</p>

<p>The manufacturing industries kept pace in their
success with that of mining and agriculture. With
the Jews a knowledge of silk culture came into
Europe, and with the assistance of Moorish skill it
became one of the leading industries and one of
the most profitable exports. All Europe, and the
greater portions of Asia and Africa, looked to the
Jews and Moors of Spain for their fine fabrics of
silk and cotton and woolen, for all the wonders of
the loom and the skilful and delicate patterns of
filigree work in gold and silver. The carpet
manufacture of the Moslems reached the excellence
which it has maintained to our own day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>They made glass out of a silicious clay and used
it for fashioning vessels, and also in glazing those
beautiful tiles&mdash;for which Valencia is still famous&mdash;called
<i>azulejos</i>, which they employed in embelishing
floors and wainscoting. The best leather was
made by the Jews and Arab-Moors in Cordova,
and hence Spanish leather is still called <i>Cordovan</i>,
which has given to English shoemakers their name
of "Cordwainers." The still celebrated "Morocco"
leather&mdash;the secret of its manufacture having been
carried to Morocco, after their expulsion from Spain,&mdash;speaks
to this day of Moorish and Jewish skill
in this branch of industry. The "Toledo Blade,"
famous in the past and famous still, the invention
of, and the plentiful and lucrative manufacture of
cotton and linen paper, that blessed boon to civilization,
which alone made the printing press possible
and beneficial, the introduction of gunpowder
and artillery, of the magnet and the mariner's
compass, of mechanical and scientific apparatus and
instruments, these and many more still speak in
eloquent terms of Moorish and Jewish industry in
Spain, and, more eloquently still, they tell the
tale of Spanish ingratitude.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
This diligence and success in agriculture and in
the industries made commerce necessarily very
active and lucrative. The ports swarmed with
vessels of traffic. The Jews and Moors of Spain
maintained a merchant marine of thousands of
ships. They had their factories and warehouses
and consuls in all centers of industry. Their exports
were very large.</p>

<p>The Jews, who had been compelled to wander
the wide world over had acquired a most perfect
geographical knowledge, which was serviceable
to them now. It was through them that the
existence of the Cape of Good Hope was made
known in Europe. It was through Averroes that
the attention of Columbus was drawn to his subject
of finding a short route to the Indies. Their commerce
opened the tide of discovery by navigation.
Moorish and Jewish industry sought foreign mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>kets
and found them, too, from the Azores to the
interior of China, from the Baltic to the coast of
Mozambique, and eventually from the kingdom of
Granada to the new world. Granada, especially in
the words of the historian, became the common
city of all nations. The reputation of its citizens
for trustworthiness was such that their bare word
was more relied on than a written contract is now
among us, to which a Catholic bishop adds:
"Moorish integrity is all that is necessary to make
a good Christian."<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
The position of the Moors and Jews of Spain in
the industries may, therefore, be briefly summarized
thus, a prosperous state of commerce arose
never known before, and in the southern part of
Europe never equalled since. Farther and farther
this commerce pushed its interests, and more and
more busy became the industries at home, and greater
and greater grew their opulence. Gradually the
rest of Europe awakened from its lethargy. Moorish
and Jewish toil infused life and ambition into
its people. Italy, Portugal, France and England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
began to compete. New markets became necessary.
New discoveries followed, and with the
general activity and prosperity which ensued, and
the learning which it fostered, it dispelled the
mists of ignorance, the middle ages disappeared and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
modern history made its appearance upon the
world's stage. So glorious was the result of
Moorish and Jewish industry. How Europe rewarded
them in return for all their labors, let the
following chapters speak.</p>

<h2 id="CHAP_XV">CHAPTER. XV.<br />
THE INQUISITION.</h2>



<p>JEWISH AND MOORISH INTELLECTUAL ADVANCE FOLLOWED BY PHYSICAL
DECLINE&mdash;THIS DECLINE THE CAUSE OF THEIR DOWNFALL&mdash;THE
SPANIARD AGAIN RULER OVER SPAIN&mdash;THE INQUISITION ESTABLISHED&mdash;TO
ESCAPE IT JEWS BECOME "NEW CHRISTIANS"&mdash;CHRISTIANITY
NO HELP TO THE JEWS&mdash;THOMAS DE
TORQUEMADA&mdash;THE TORTURES OF THE INQUISITION&mdash;A
PUBLIC BURNING.</p>


<p class="p2">Physical decline follows mental advance. The
nation that is devoted to learning is not the nation
that worships a military life, or the pursuits of
warfare. When the Mohammedans started on
the enterprise of acquiring vast territorial possessions,
there were few nations, if any, that could
stand before them; when they were bent upon
making intellectual acquisitions, there was no military
body in Europe so poor that could not overthrow
them. The military and patriotic virtues of
the Arab-Moors had slowly passed away. Their
original simplicity had been replaced by the extravagance
of Oriental luxury, and their early devotedness
to the Moslem faith had suffered much
from their philosophical and scientific researches.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Internecine wars among themselves hastened their
decline. Faster and faster their once invincible
power slipped from their hands. Faster and faster
advanced the Spanish hosts. Arab-Moor and
Spanish Christian met at last on the plains of
"Las Navas," (1213) and the great defeat which
the Moslem army sustained here marked the beginning
of the fatal hour. City after city, province
after province, they were forced to yield.
At last, all was lost, save the city of Granada,
which stood alone to represent the Mohammedan
dominion in the peninsula. And, for a
time, it seemed as if that noble city, the city of
the Alhambra, the pride of the Moors, would
not only represent the Mohammedan dominion,
and stay the victorious advance of the Spanish
hosts, but also regain all that had been lost.</p>

<p>But the ancient valor was aroused too late.
Ferdinand, of Aragon, had married Isabella, of
Castile. Two of the most powerful crowns and
armies were united, and unitedly they marched
against the city of Granada.</p>

<p>Granada surrendered. On the second day of
January, 1492, the last and ill-fated king of the
Moors, Boabdil (Abu Abdillah,) met Ferdinand
and his party at the entrance of the Alhambra, and
presenting the keys of the city, thus he spoke in
a loud voice and in sad accents:</p>

<p>"We are thine, O powerful and exalted king;
these are the keys of this paradise. We deliver
into thy hands this city and kingdom, for such is
the will of Allah: and we trust thou wilt use thy
triumph with generosity and clemency."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"We trust thy wilt use thy triumph with generosity
and clemency." Did Boabdil have a foreboding
of the infamous use the victor would make
of his triumph? Did he really expect that his
appeal for generosity and clemency would be favorably
answered? If so, poor Boabdil, vain is thy
hope, foolish thy trust. That hour in which the
Christian <i>cross</i> replaced the Mohammedan <i>crescent</i>
on the turret of the Alhambra, that hour
when Christianity ruled again, and alone, in the
peninsula, marked a climax in the history of cruelties
and human sufferings. That hour, though
the brightest in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella,
was most fatal for Spain, most pitiful to Europe,
most unfortunate for civilization, and most
calamitous for the Jews.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During all these unfortunate years of struggle
for supremacy between the Mohammedan and
Christian hosts the Jews were not forgotten. Sad
as was the lot of the Moors, that of the Jews were
inexpressibly more miserable. The Moors were
conquered by soldiers, the Jews by monks. The
Moors fought against the military of Spain, the
Jews were inhumanly slaughtered by the "militia
of Christ." The Moors suffered the pangs of war,
and the Jews writhed in agony under the tortures
of the Inquisition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Inquisition! Who can utter the execrable word
without a shudder! Who can think of this blood-thirsty
institution without heaving a sigh of relief
that it lasts no longer! What Jew can think of it
with dry eyes, without lifting his heart to God in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
thanksgiving that this blood-reeking tribunal is
no more!</p>

<p>Inquisition! Who knows its meaning better
than the Jews? What people brought greater
sacrifice to its bloody altars than they? Who has
described it better than the Jew, <i>Samuel Usque</i>,
the Jewish poet, whose lyre was silenced, and
whose life was tortured out of his body by that
very institution which he so eloquently and truthfully
describes? "From Rome," he says, "a beast
most monstrous, most ferocious, and most foul
has come into our midst. Its very appearance
strikes terror into every soul. When it raises its
piercing, hissing, seething voice all Europe trembles.
Its body is made of a composition of the
hardest of steel and the deadliest of poison. In
strength, in capacity for murder, in size and in
speed it excels the fiercest of lions, the most poisonous
of serpents, the tallest of elephants, and
the speediest of eagles. Its very voice will kill
quicker than the bite of the basilisk. Fire issues
from its eyes, its jaws breathe forth flames. It
lives from human bodies only. Wherever it
comes, and though the sunshine in its noontide
brightness, the densest darkness will at once set
in. In its presence every blade of grass, every
flower and blossom and tree, all wither and perish.
Wherever it passes its pestiferous stench changes
fertile valleys and luxurious fields and laughing
meadows into unproductive deserts and howling
wastes. Its name is <i>The Inquisition</i>."</p>

<p>It was born in the early part of the thirteenth
century. Fanaticism was its mother; its father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was St. Dominic, who also was the father of the
Dominican Order, and so the Inquisition
and the Dominican friars were natural brothers,
and "par nobile fratrum," a noble pair of brothers
they were. Pope Innocent III. stood godfather to
it. I fully sympathize with all past and present
humanitarians in their efforts to wean men from the
pernicious belief in the existence of Hell, but I can
not accept their claims that Hell never existed.
Hell did exist, not 10,000 leagues beneath the
earth, but on its very face. Hell existed wherever
the Inquisition lived. And Devils there were, too,
and their names were "Dominican Monks." This
ferocious beast-child came into this world with a
mission: to detect, punish and suppress Heresy,
Free Thought, and every Religious belief save that
of the Church of St. Peter. Under Dominican
nursing and training, it grew and prospered, and
rapidly acquired a relentless exercise of its
mission. Its heart was killed, its conscience stifled.
It was never taught the meaning of the words pity
and mercy.</p>

<p>Scarcely was it full grown when it initiated its
bloody career of 600 years of accursed life by a
most cruel reign of terror in the southern provinces
of France, where the presence and strength of
the heretical <i>Albigenses</i> and where the Moorish
and Jewish civilization from across the Pyrenees
had made themselves felt. The reign of terror
ceased with the extermination of almost the entire
population.</p>

<p>At last it found its way into Spain, and in that
country it entered upon a career so infamous that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
its deeds of ferocity, recorded upon the annals
of History in letters of blood and fire, are not
eclipsed by the combined cruelties of all mankind.
Here lived and prospered thousands and thousands
of Jews. When a holy war is waged against the
infidel Moors shall the infidel Jews escape unscathed?
When the Blessed Virgin crowns their
zeal to their faith by giving them victory after
victory over the Moors, will she not be wroth if the
Jews escape? When the Moors are put to the
edge of the sword, shall the Jews not be committed
to the flames?</p>

<p>The cruelties of the Inquisition were not the
first which were visited upon the Jews. Their
second series of suffering in Spain began on the
day when the Christian forces defeated the Moorish
army upon the battle-field. The tolerance the
Moor could afford to offer to the Jew, the Religion
of Christ could not. In Aragon and Castile
it was not a rare sight to see the fanatical populace,
stimulated by the no less fanatical clergy, to
make a fierce assault upon this unfortunate people&mdash;guilty
of no other crime than that of promoting
the prosperity of Spain and of adhering to their inherited
belief,&mdash;breaking into their houses, violating
their most private sanctuaries, and consigning
them by the thousands to indiscriminate massacre,
without regard to sex or age. Hatred of the Jews
was for many centuries a faithful index of the
piety of the Christians. Cruel laws were enacted
against them. They were prohibited from mingling
freely with the Christians, from following the
trades and professions for which they were best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
suited by virtue of their high intelligence and
thrift. Their residence was restricted within
certain prescribed limits of the cities which they
inhabited. They were held up to continuous
public scorn, by being compelled to wear a peculiar
dress, on which was sewed their badge of shame.
Even in their executions they were branded, for
a long time they were hanged between two dogs,
and with the head downwards.</p>

<p>A choice was given them to escape these sufferings
and degradations by entering "the religion
of love unto all men." Thousands upon thousands
of Jews availed themselves of this only alternative,
and became feigned converts, or "new Christians,"
as they were called. They amply regretted
the change later, but at present it seemed to them
an almost justifiable step. The preceding chapters
have acquainted us with the character of the
Spanish Jews, with their high intellectual attainments,
with their lofty demeanor, with their high
social and political and industrial and commercial
standing. Think of them now asked to sacrifice
all these advantages, because the iron-handed
and iron-hearted brute force of the priests so
wanted it. Feel as they must have felt, when they
were asked to exchange their mansions of elegance
and refinement for the wretched hovels of
the Ghetto; to lay aside their garments of silk,
and their ornaments of grace and beauty and
costliness, and don the gaberdine of disgrace;
to drop the reins of the world's commerce which
they held in their hands, and, instead, take a pack
upon their back and wander from house to house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
an object of ridicule and shame, and jeers and
maltreatment. Think as they must have felt and
thought and you will think less harshly of their
feigned change of faith.</p>

<p>For a time all seemed bright. The "converts"
were especially honored. They were appointed
even to high ecclesiastical and municipal offices;
their sons and daughters married into noble, and
even royal families.</p>

<p>The few drops of baptismal water did not, however,
change the character of the Jews. Their
prosperity was as great as before, and, unlike the
credulous and superstitious Spaniards, they failed
to see any reason why they should lavish their
worldly goods upon the Church. They preferred
to do their own "taking care of," and their own
"praying for" their soul. This was their crime.
Their superior skill and industry, and the superior
riches which these qualities secured, and their
high standing in the community, aroused the
priesthood's envy and covetousness. Thus the
charge arose that the converts had relapsed into
their old faith.</p>

<p>The charge was not unfounded. The allegiance
to the Church was that of compulsion, and it never
was anything else, except a masked external allegiance.
The heart, soul, conscience, mind, continued
Jewish, and as fervently so as ever before.
This "scandalous spectacle of apostates returning
to wallow in the ancient mire of Judaism," was
the pretext by means of which the Dominicans
sounded the alarm. And the Inquisition came to
cure them of their back-sliding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Castile, the kingdom of Isabella, had till then
refused admission to the Inquisition. At one time
its introduction was recommended, and the whole
populace arose in rebellion. Isabella herself
trembled at the very mention of it. But in an
evil hour <i>Thomas de Torquemada</i>, "condemned
to infamous immortality by the signal part which
he performed in the tragedy of the Inquisition,"
became her confessor. That man&mdash;if "man" I
may name him&mdash;that vilest blot upon the history
of religion, of Spain, of civilization, was the fiend
incarnate. His very name still represents the
superlative of maniacal fanaticism. He labored
hard to infuse into the pure mind of the noble
hearted Isabella a fanaticism as fiendish as was
his. And still she recoiled from the thought of
introducing the monstrous slaughtering institution
in her domains. Torquemada brought the weight
of the entire church to bear upon her conscience,
and still she refused. The fiend was not yet
baffled. He influenced her husband, the crafty
and greedy Ferdinand of Aragon, to advocate his
cause. The husband prevailed.</p>

<p>On the 2nd day of January, 1481, the Inquisition
commenced operation in the city of Seville,
with Thomas de Torquemada as Inquisitor General
of Castile and Aragon. A few years later
it found its way into every prominent town of
Spain, and confined itself everywhere almost wholly
to the Jews. The severity, and savage alacrity
of it, may best be learned from the appalling fact
that during the eighteen years of Torquemada's
ministry an average of more than 6,000 convicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
persons suffered annually from this cruel tribunal
by burning, or by condemnation to life long slavery,
or by endless torture, making an average of nearly
seventeen a day, and the entire number punished
during its existence in Spain, from 1481 to
1808, amounted to 340,000 persons.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>All this to protect the interests of religion. All
this for offenses so trivial that our blood boils
with indignation at the very thought of the heinous
cruelty. It was sufficient to burn a "convert," as a
relapsed heretic, upon the mere accusations of
crimes such as these: That he wore better clothes
or cleaner linen on the Jewish Sabbath than on other
days of the week; that he had no fire in his house
on the Jewish Sabbath; that he ate the meat of animals
slaughtered by Jews; that he abstained from
eating pork; that he gave his child a Hebrew
name&mdash;and yet he was prohibited by law, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
severe penalties, from giving a Christian name&mdash;that
on the Day of Atonement he had asked forgiveness;
that he had laid his hands in blessing
upon his child's head, without the sign of the cross,
and numerous others, equally as harmless. Most
of the charges did not even prove a relapse, their
observance being, for the most, either purely accidental
or the result of early habit, or, what was
most frequently the case, pure invention. No
better chance existed for wreaking vengeance, on
a Jew. A simple accusation, even anonymously,
sufficed. For the accused there was no safety
against malice; no facing the accuser, who perhaps,
was his bitterest enemy; no trial; no cross-examination;
no justice. He was put under arrest
and conveyed to the secret chambers of the Inquisition,
where, cut off from the world, he remained,
sometimes for months, in complete ignorance
of the nature of the charges preferred against
him. Once there, the famous words of Dante
may be well applied to him: "<i>Lasciate ogni
speranze voich'entrate</i>." "All hope abandon, ye
who enter here."</p>

<p>At last he would be summoned before the Inquisitors
and asked to confess. And well for
him if he plead guilty. It is true, he will be convicted,
but he has escaped the tortures which are
well nigh beyond the power of endurance, and
which will soon force a confession, true or not true,
or which, even if endured, cannot save him, as he
will nevertheless be convicted on the strength of
positions of the accuser.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall spare you a recital of the tortures, of the
sufferings endured in the deepest vaults of the
Inquisition, where the cries of the victims could
fall on no ear save that of the tormentors. It is
difficult to realize that these iron-hearted and
iron-handed henchmen, who thus eagerly, passionately,
with a thirst for blood that knew no
mercy, with zeal that never tired, devoted their
whole life to cruelties such as we encounter here,
could have been human beings, much less ministers
of Christ. I shall spare you and spare myself
a recital of these sufferings. I shall not speak
of the tortures by rack and rope, and fire and
water, how the victims' joints were dislocated, how
every bone in their body was broken, how the
body was roasted over a slow fire. I cannot
speak of these tortures. I can only refer you to
"<i>The History of The Inquisition</i>," by Don Juan
Antonio Llorento, whose records are authentic,
as he himself was Secretary to the Inquisition;
or to Mosheim's "<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>," or to
Prescott's "<i>Ferdinand and Isabella</i>," volume I,
chapter VII. To endure all these tortures, and
live, was thought positive proof of Satanic life, and
the strongest ground for burning. Nearly all
plead guilty to whatever they were accused of,
and to more, too, after a short experience with the
rack. And confession brought public burning.</p>

<p>This was the last scene in the bloody tragedy,
so wrongly named "Auto De Fe" ("Act of Faith").
It was a gala day for the town in which it was
enacted. The proudest grandees of the land acted
as escorts to the ecclesiastical henchmen. The roya<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>l
party seldom missed this pompous ceremony,
and not infrequently heaped fagots on the blazing
fire with their own hands. A military escort
led the unfortunate victims, clad in coarse yellow
garments called "<i>san benitos</i>" garnished with a
scarlet cross, and with hideous figures of devils
and flames of fire. And a horrible appearance
they presented, emaciated, lacerated, crippled,
dazed by the light and fresh air which had been
denied them for months.</p>

<p>The pyre is lighted. The flames shoot up.
The victims writhe in agony.</p>

<p>Lo! a fierce wind arises. For a moment it
blows the flames from the bodies. One of the
victims speaks. It is Antonio Joseph, the Jewish
celebrated author and classical dramatist of Portugal,
where the performance of his dramatic pieces
draws tears even to this day. Thus the venerable
sage speaks:</p>

<p>"I own I belong to a faith which you yourselves
acknowledge to be of Divine origin. God loved
this religion, and He, according to my belief, is
still attached to it, while you think He has ceased
to be so; and because your belief differs from
mine, you condemn those who are of the opinion
that God continues to love what He formerly
loved. You demand that we should become
Christians, and yet you are far from being
Christians yourselves. Be at least men, and act
towards us as reasonable as if you had no religion
at all to guide you and no revelation for your enlightenment."
"<i>Osseitaro barbaro</i>" ("clip his
beard"), some of the spectators shout, and im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>mediately
one of the executioners besmears his
venerable beard, by means of a long brush, with
pitch and turpentine, and sets fire to it. One
more cry, "<i>Sh'ma, Yisrael, Adonay Elahenu,
Adonay Echad</i>" ("Hear, O Israel, the Eternal,
Our God is One"), and the flames have done their
work, amidst the rapturous applause of the spectators,
and amidst the pious ejaculations: "Blessed
be forever the goodness and mercy of the Holy
Inquisition. Blessed be the Holy Trinity, the
sister of the Virgin Mary." Not a tear among
the spectators. Father, mother, husband, wife,
child, relatives, friends, all are eye-witnesses to
this bloody sacrifice, and yet from them not a sigh
of regret, nor dare they be absent, nor dare they
abstain from applauding, that would fasten suspicion
upon them, and condemn them to a similar
fate. A confiscation of the convicted possessions
ended the mournful tragedy.</p>

<p>Such was the clemency and generosity for
which Boabdil, the last of the Moorish kings, entreated.
Praised be God, now and forever, who
has emancipated us from the clemency and generosity
of the Church.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />

EXPULSION OF THE JEWS.</h2>



<p>TORQUEMADA RESOLVES UPON IMMEDIATE EXPULSION OF ALL UNCONVERTED
JEWS.&mdash;THE FATAL EDICT.&mdash;THE SPANIARDS MOVED TO PITY.&mdash;DON
ISAAC ABARBANEL PLEADS WITH THE QUEEN.&mdash;THE
QUEEN HESITATES.&mdash;TORQUEMADA, THE FIEND, CONQUERS
AGAIN.&mdash;THE ILL-FATED JEWS SEEK AMONG THE DEAD
THE PITY WHICH THE LIVING REFUSE.&mdash;THE
DEPARTURE.</p>


<p class="p2">With tearful eyes and bleeding heart we have
seen portrayed the mournful and tragic fate of
the Jews and Moors in Spain. We were unwilling
eye-witnesses to sufferings and cruelties, which
we knew had never been equalled, and thought
could never be surpassed. We thought we had
seen the climax of maniacal fanaticism. We
thought well might Thomas de Torquemada recline
now beneath the laurels of infamous immortality
he had won for himself, and henceforth
concentrate his frenzied zeal upon religious efforts,
less iron-hearted and less murderous. We
thought now that Spain had completely vanquished
the Moor, had degraded the Jews, had
successfully taught the "convert" Jews a most
"burning" love for the Christian faith, by means of
the Inquisition's pitiless, slaughtering tribunal, now
that greed and bigotry and viciousness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
ambition had been satiated, we thought Ferdinand
and Isabella would halt in their unpitying and unmerciful
career, would pause long enough to gaze
upon the terrible calamities they had inflicted
upon the realm and upon innocent people, and
would hasten to amend their ways, and repair
their great wrongs.</p>

<p>It was natural for us to think so. It is the experience
of mankind that reaction accompanied by
remorse, ever follows close upon the heels of
rampant fury; that generosity and clemency, however
fiercely the infuriated storms had lashed them
into savage atrocity, will seek and find again their
unruffled calm. It is therefore we stand aghast
at beholding the next brutish inhumanity of
Torquemada. Of a truth, he is not man but fiend,
for to him principles which guide the actions of
human beings are not applicable. For him there
exists no reaction and no remorse, no generosity
and no clemency. Where the most cruel of
the cruel tremble at the mere thought, he executes
sportively and in cold blood. Where others rest
their blood-reeking weapons in the belief that they
have reached, at last, the summit of crime, he
heartlessly advances as upon mere stepping stones
to far greater cruelties to come. He knew why
he apprehended assassination now. He knew
why he secured an escort now of fifty horse and
two hundred foot. He was about to perpetrate a
crime that should throw into the shade all that he
had enacted hitherto.</p>

<p>The fate of the Moors had been decided. The
Inquisition thinned the ranks of the "convert" Jews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
The unconverted Jews, they that had preferred
degradation to baptism; they that had preferred to
take up their wretched abode as degraded outcasts
in the prescribed outskirts of the cities, to
feigning adherence to a faith which their hearts
hated; they that had sacrificed with singular
resignation all that honest toil had honestly
secured, and donned the garberdine of disgrace,
and followed the degrading vocations enforced
upon them by cruel laws, and suffered everywhere
meekly unprovoked jeers, insult, outrage,
assault, these must be dealt with now.
Torquemada was resolved, and with him resolve
was equal to execution, that in Spain the sun
should shine upon none but pure Catholics, that
the atmosphere of Spain should no longer be polluted
by the presence of Jews; that none but
"pious" Christians should tread upon its holy soil.
He resolved upon expelling the Jews forever.
They had long clogged the wheels of his triumphal
car. He knew that there was a secret communion
between "converted" and unconverted Jews.
He knew that it was mainly due to their religious
influence that the convert Jews relapsed again into
Judaism. He knew that they provided spiritually
and physically for the poverty-stricken and branded
families of those of their race, whom the Inquisition
burned, and whose possessions it confiscated.
He knew that, despite rigorous measures and
Dominican spies, converted and unconverted Jews
met in subterranean caverns, and counseled and
worshipped together, and comforted each other.
He hit upon a cure at last. He knew a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
remedy that would remove the clog forever.
He counselled immediate expulsion of all unconverted
Jews.</p>

<p>In the year 1492, in the year in which Columbus
discovered a new world, in the year in which
the Jewish sailor of Columbus' crew first set foot
upon the virgin soil of the western Hemisphere,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
strange fatality, in the same year that Spain opens
domains vast, destined to become the land of the
free, the blessed haven for the politically and racially
and religiously persecuted; in the same year, the
year 1492, she opens her portals at home, only to
thrust out, mercilessly, brutally, hundreds of
thousands of unoffending, industrious, intelligent
people, closes the gates behind them, and keeps
them barred nigh unto four hundred years.</p>

<p>On the 30th of March, 1492, the edict for the
expulsion of the Jews from Spain was signed by
the Spanish sovereigns at Granada. Torquemada
had triumphed. He had conquered the scruples
of king and queen and Grandees. The edict,
schemed and defended by him, had passed, and
the faithful execution thereof he took upon himself.
Heralds proclaimed from the street corners of
every hamlet and village and city of Spain, that
all unconverted Jews, of whatever sex or age or condition,
should depart from the realm before the expiration
of four months, never to revisit it, on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
pretext whatever, under penalty of death, that all
who should remain in the realm after the expiration
of the four months would be put to death, as also all
such Christian subjects, who should harbor, succor,
or minister to the necessities of any Jew, after the
expiration the term limited for his departure; that
the Jews dispose in the meanwhile of their
possessions as best they can, but are prohibited,
under penalty of death, from having gold or silver
in their possession at the time of their departure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Unfortunate Jews! It was an idle hope when,
seeing the sky lurid from the burning of your
brethren upon the <i>quemaderos</i> (places of burning
heretics), you thought that the cup of your afflictions
was full at last. It was an idle hope, when, thinking
of the invaluable services you rendered unto
Spain, you thought her people could not possibly
visit still greater calamities upon your innocent
heads. Unfortunate Jews! Ye thought not of
Torquemada, the fiend, when you fondly nursed
these hopes.</p>

<p>When the edict was read from the corners of
the streets and from the cross-roads, as the words
that convey the sentence of death, strike terror in
the heart of the condemned:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i2">"So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.</div>
<div class="line">Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then arose</div>
<div class="line">Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anguish." * *</div>
<div class="line i12"><i>&mdash;Longfellow's "Evangeline."</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Maddening thought. Frenzied they rushed to
and fro. Cries of terror and despair pierced the
air. The Sierra Morena to the South, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Pyrenees to the North re-echoed the heart-rending
wailing of the stricken ones.</p>

<p>Whither shall they flee? What country will
dare offer them hospitable shores, when the greatest
power in Europe thrusts them out helplessly,
defencelessly, with a brand of infamy upon their
brow?</p>

<p>Maddening thought, to go forth as exiles from
the land of their birth, from their sweet domestic
hearths, where they were wont to sit and tell of
their long and proud and glorious past; to go
forth from Spain, whose very soil seemed holy
in their eyes; to leave Spain, that had been their
fatherland for 1500 years, and more, long before
the race of their present persecutors had heard
of it, or had yet been civilized; to leave behind all
that is near and dear to the human heart; the
home of their proud achievements; the soil that
held the graves of their own relatives and friends
and of their illustrious sires, whose names had
shed a brilliancy of light, that illuminated the darkness
of their ages, and all the ages since; to leave
Spain, whose very name was rapture to their souls;
to leave it, never to return again; to leave home,
possessions, friends, and go forth into the very
jaws of death&mdash;on, ye Dominican fiends; slay
them at once. If die they must, let them breathe
their last upon the soil, which, next to Palestine,
they worshipped most, but thrust them not out to
perish in foreign lands.</p>

<p>Nay, we cannot conceive, to-day, the terror
of this edict. Imagine, forbid it God&mdash;the very
thought makes us shudder&mdash;imagine that an edict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
were suddenly to be issued that the 300,000 Jews of
the United States&mdash;such was the number of the
Jews of Spain&mdash;should be exiled from this country
after the expiration of four months, never to return
again; imagine such a calamity to befall us here,
where our past is not yet a century old, and where
the memories and associations of the past are not
so deeply rooted as were those of Spain; imagine
that we were told to go forth, branded with infamy,
to cope, helplessly and defencelessly, and hopelessly
with a hostile world; told to leave behind all
that honest toil had gained for us; imagine
that we had to assemble at the sea coast on
a given day, to be packed into ships, like
so many cattle, wives torn from husbands, babes
from mothers, brothers from sisters, and then
carried off, thousands of us to be hurled into the
foaming deep, thousands to perish from want
and exposure and cruelty, thousands to be disembarked
upon uninhabited islands to be left a prey
to wild beasts and starvation, thousands to be
dropped on foreign shores, only to meet with still
greater cruelties than were hitherto inflicted.
Picture to yourself, if you can, miseries as terrible
as these, happening unto us to-day, forbid it
Heaven!&mdash;and even then will you only barely
realize the calamity of this edict.</p>

<p>The sad fate which awaited the Jews touched
the hearts of even the Spaniards. A delegation
of them, including the most powerful grandees of
the realm, waited upon the sovereigns, and implored
them to revoke the terrible decree. Ferdinand
and Isabella turned deaf ears to their en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>treaties.
The great Don Isaac Abarbanel, the
last of the brilliant lights of the Jews in Spain, a
high officer in the service of Queen Isabella, threw
himself at her feet, and in heart-rending sobs he
burst forth:</p>

<p>"Ask for our life, and it is thine; ask for all our
possessions, they are thine, but if live we must,
then, Illustrious Queen, drive us not from off the
soil of Spain which is dearer to us than our life."</p>

<p>For a moment her inflexible will wavered,
another moment, and the mourning of 300,000
people might have been turned to rejoicing, and
the doom of Spain might have been averted, and
the history of Europe might have had a different
reading to-day. But that other moment was never
to come. Torquemada, who listened in an adjoining
chamber to Abarbanel's tearful entreaty,
and to the queen's yielding words, rushed into the
royal presence, almost mad with fury, and pointing
to the crucifix, he shrieked:</p>

<p>"Behold Him whom Judas Iscariot sold for
thirty pieces of silver! Sell him now for a higher
price, and render an account of your bargain before
God!"</p>

<p>The fiend had conquered again. The queen is
on her knees before him, imploring forgiveness
for her moment's weakness.</p>

<p>A gloom pervaded the entire realm, as the time
of the departure drew hastily on. The Jews, attired
in the deepest mourning, wandered restlessly
about the streets. Peace dwelled no longer in
their homes. Their fountain of tears had run dry.
Their words became fewer, and more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
painful. When children twined their little arms
lovingly about their parents' neck, when pining
husbands gazed upon their drooping wives, and
in their mournful silence asked one another: A
month hence, a fortnight hence, a week hence,
to-morrow, where will father be? Where will
mother be? What fate awaits husband, and
what misery shall fall upon wife? What cruelty
shall subdue brother, and to what life of infamy
shall sister be sold? When upon such questions
they brooded, and when did they not? madness
seized upon them, and they rushed out to the burial
places, and there, among the dead, they sought
the pity and mercy and consolation the living
could not give; there, in the graveyards, they
lingered among the tombs of their dear departed,
sometimes for three or four days in succession,
not a morsel of food nor a drop of water passing
their lips. And as they fixed their gaze upon the
stately palms, that shaded them and the graves of
their dead, with aching heart they lingered low:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"More blest each palm that shades those plains</div>
<div class="line">Than Israel's scattered race;</div>
<div class="line">For, taking root, it there remains</div>
<div class="line">In solitary grace;</div>
<div class="line">It cannot quit its place of birth,</div>
<div class="line">It will not live in other earth.</div>
<div class="line">But we must wander witheringly</div>
<div class="line">In other lands to die;</div>
<div class="line">And where our fathers' ashes be,</div>
<div class="line">Our own may never lie."</div>
<div class="line i9"><i>&mdash;Byron's "Hebrew Melodies."</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Meanwhile the Spanish clergy was not idle. In
the synagogues, in the public squares, in the open
streets they preached the Love and Gentleness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the Redeemer, and appealed by argument, and
by foul invectives, to the Jews, to accept the few
drops of baptismal water, and remain in their
adored native land. The Jews listened with a
sullen indifference to these harangues. The suffering
they endured for their faith convinced them
more than ever of the absurdity of that religion
which could inflict such cruelties. The treatment
which the "convert" Jews received at the hands
of their "Christian" brethren was surely not such
as could inspire them with a burning desire for a
change of faith. Rather exile, separation from
fond home and fonder family, rather death than
adopt a faith that fattened on blood and thrived
on cruelty. "Let us remain firm," they cried to
cheer on one another, "strong in our faith before our
God, unyielding before our foes. We will live, if
we are to live, if we are to die, we will die. Yet,
living or dying, our covenant let us not desecrate;
let our hearts never despair, let us never forsake, not
even in the darkest hour, the living God of Israel."
Noble sons and daughters of Israel. Ye sainted
spirits of our departed ancestors of Spain, our
hearts are filled with noble pride as we recount
your heroic devotion to our God-given faith. In
vain we turn the leaves of Historic record to find
a parallel to your unswerving homage to conviction.
Time can not diminish the lustre of your
self-sacrificing deeds for the cause of Israel's
truths. Four hundred years have silently emptied
into the interminable Ocean of Time, and still
Jew and Gentile, believer and unbeliever, all who
worship at the shrine of political and racial and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
religious liberty, name you but to bless you, and
are themselves inspired to virtue by their very
breathing of your sainted names and heroic deeds.</p>

<p>At last the day for their departure arrived, August
2nd, 1492, the 9th day of <i>Ab. Tisha b'Ab</i>, 5252.
The time had expired July 31, but they had implored
for two days of grace, that this, their great
calamity, might fall on <i>Tisha b'Ab</i>, the 9th of <i>Ab</i>,
the annual day of fasting, the most calamitous day
in the history of Israel.</p>

<p>It was on that day (586 B. C.) that <i>Nebukadneezar</i>
laid the Temple of Solomon in ruins, and led
the children of Israel from Palestine, as captives,
to Babylon.</p>

<p>It was on that day (70 A. C.) that <i>Titus</i> destroyed
the Second Temple, ended forever the political
power and national life of Israel, and thrust
the children of Israel from their native soil, the
sacred soil of Palestine.</p>

<p>It was on that day (135 A. C.) that the fate of
the <i>Barkochba</i> revolution was decided, and the
last hope of Israel for political independence had
vanished, and vanished forever.</p>

<p>And it was in the early morning of the same
fatal day <i>Tisha b'Ab, 5252, August 2, 1492</i>, that
the Jews of Spain repaired to their synagogues
to worship there, for the last time, to sit upon the
ground, with dust and ashes upon their heads,
and girded with sack cloth, and read in accents
sad, in accordance with an old established custom
in Israel, Jeremiah's "<i>Lamentations</i>" over the destruction
of the Temple, over the fall of Jerusalem
and over the exile of the children of Israel into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Babylon. They had read the "Lamentations"
before, they had read them year after year with
tremulous lips, with accents fervent and deep, but
they never knew their meaning before. That
morning the broken heart spoke. And oh, what
wails of sorrow, what sobs of contrition, what
passionate out-breaks, as they repeated the verses:</p>

<p>"How does the city sit solitary, that was full of
people. How is she become as a widow! she
that was great among the nations. She weepeth
sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks,
among all her friends she hath none to comfort
her. Judah is gone into captivity because of
affliction, she dwelleth among the nations, she
findeth no rest. Her adversaries are powerful,
her enemies prosper, all that honored her despise
her. It is nothing to you, all ye that pass by?
Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto
my sorrow, which is done unto me. Zion spreadeth
forth her hands and there is none to comfort
her. They cried unto them: Depart ye, ye
are unclean, touch not, when they fled away
and wandered, they said among the nations: they
shall no more sojourn there. They hunt our steps,
that we cannot go into our streets, our end is near,
our days are fulfilled, for our end is come."</p>

<p>And forth they went from the house of God, the
old and the young, the sick and the helpless,
virgin and youth, bride and groom, man, woman,
child, with hearts bleeding, with steps tottering,
with faces haggard and hollow and wan, with
figure bent, and spirit broken as they gazed with
a vacant stare for the last time upon their emptied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
homes upon the desolate scenes of childhood and
youth.</p>

<p>On they went, overwhelmed yet speechless.
But over them a chorus of martyr spirits, they that
on that day perished, for their faith's sake, at the
siege of Nebuchadnezzar, they on that day breathed
their last for Israel's sake, at the siege of Titus,
they that on that day had died with the death of
Israel's hope, at the siege of Julius Severus, over
the exiles of Spain, these martyr spirits chanted
with doleful voices:</p>

<p>Thus mournfully closed the last chapter. These
are sad words, fraught with anguish and
despair, yet however sad, however despondent
and hopeless, however much of grief, and anguish
and despair they convey, they befell the Jews of
Spain, and they fail altogether, when they are
asked to describe the sufferings and miseries
which met the unfortunate exiles, everywhere, in
their fruitless search for a quiet spot where they
might live or die in peace. Ships stood ready in
the harbors to carry nearly all of the banished
300,000 Jews whithersoever it suited the captains
best. Into these ships the exiles were literally
packed, crowded together without regard to sex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
or age, often mother torn from child, husband
from wife, brother from sister, friends from friends,
and, separated on the coast meant separation forever.</p>

<p>Words and the heart fail me to speak of the
heart-rending cries of parent for child, and child
for parent; of husband for wife and wife for husband;
or of the wailing and lamenting, as Spain,
the land of their birth, the home of their comfort
and luxury and blessings, slowly faded out of sight
and finally disappeared beneath the horizon.</p>

<p>And now begins a chapter in the history of
Israel's suffering so frightful, so revolting that the
pen and tongue recoil from dwelling upon it in
detail. Before these sufferings, all that had been
hitherto endured, faded into insignificance. And
again it is avarice, and rapacity that bring these
miseries upon them. The possession of the gold
brought on their former sufferings, and now it is
the want of it that opens their present miseries.
Thou miserable gold! Whether ally or whether
foe, ever thou wast the cause of Israel's
untold sufferings! Because of thee, they had to
purchase life, and because of thee they had to
suffer death! The expulsion edict had prohibited
the Jews, under penalty of death, from having
money in their possession at their departure. And
the Jews obeyed the mandate. What cared they
for money when they could not enjoy it in their
beloved Spain? What cared they for enjoyment,
or even for life, when it was to be lived in distant
and hostile lands? But the pirate captains and
their heartless crews felt convinced, that the Jews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
must have large sums of money sewed up in their
clothes, or concealed on their persons. No sooner
were they on high sea, when men and women and
children were ordered on deck, commanded to disrobe
publicly, regardless of innocence of youth
and modesty of sex. Many a virgin and
many a youth, many a husband and many a
wife dared to resist, not that they had money concealed,
but for shame sake, and the raging
billows rocked them into their eternal sleep for
their resistance. Disappointed in their search, their
thirst for gold was the more excited. Body after
body they ripped open, before the eyes of the unfortunate
exiles, in the belief that they must have swallowed
their gold and precious jewels. And disappointed
in this, there followed a scene, a more detestable
and dastardly one the sun never shone upon.
When the sailors had finally satiated their brutal
lusts upon the innocent and helpless, and faint from
terror and torture, and when the still surviving
victims had been made to cleanse the ships from
every trace of the blood of their friends and kin,
they were seized and dropped into the ocean
without a pang of conscience, and as unconcernedly
as if the great God had created Jews for no
other purpose but to appease the beastly appetites
of inhuman sailors, and serve as food for the
fishes of the sea.</p>

<p>And all this for the glory of Christianity! All
this in obedience to the teachings of the Church!
Heaven! Who can name the crimes that have been
perpetrated in Thy name? What seas of human
blood have been shed in the name of Christ, of
Mercy and Love and Peace and Good Will! The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Church had steeled the heart against every sentiment
of pity and mercy. Feelings of compunction
of remorse in the perpetration of crimes against
the Jews, were taught to be the crime, and not
the crime itself. The tear of sympathy wrung
out by the sight of Jewish suffering was taught to
to be an offense to be expiated by humiliating
penance. Any one, it was taught, might conscientiously
kill a Jew wherever he had an opportunity.
The taste of blood, once gratified, begat
a cannibal appetite in the people, and the more it
was satisfied the more intense became its thirst
for blood. Their zeal was not altogether unselfish;
every Jew accused of heresy, or killed, cancelled&mdash;so
the Church taught for the accuser one hundred
days from his future purgatory punishment.</p>

<p>Another captain was somewhat more merciful;
whether he had to expiate some of his tenderheartness
by humiliating penance, ecclesiastical
history has neglected to record. He set all his
exiles on the shore upon a desert coast, leaving
the weak and the suffering pitilessly a prey to
wild beasts and to starvation. One of these
unfortunate deserted exiles who survived, tells us
how he saw his wife perish before his eyes, how
he himself fainted with exhaustion, and upon
awakening beheld his two children dead by his
side. For weeks, roots and grass furnished their
food. Each day brought fresh miseries and fresh
graves. These were days such as Shakespeare
speaks of:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line i12">"Each new morn&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">New widows howl; new orphans cry; new sorrows</div>
<div class="line">Strike heaven on the face."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Mothers, unable to bear the pining of their
children, struck them dead, and then took their
own life. Whole families folded themselves in
loving embrace, and while thus embracing ended
their life with their own hand. When the wild
beasts came upon them, the exiles plunged into
the sea, and stood shivering in the water for hours
and hours, until the beasts retreated. Wearily
they made their way onward, until, at last, they
beheld the joyous sight of human settlements.
Exhausted, they lay along the coasts, wasted by
suffering and disease, and half demented from
starvation. Down to the shore came the priests,
and holding a crucifix in the one hand, and provisions
in the other, the unfortunate Jews were
given the choice between Christ and starvation.
The flesh was stronger than the spirit. They
begged for the bread, and ate at it ravenously, after
the few drops of baptismal water had cleansed
their soul from the foulest stains of infidelity.
"Thus," says a pious Castilian historian, "thus
the calamities of these poor blind creatures proved
in the end an excellent remedy, that God
made use of, to unseal their eyes, so that, renouncing
their ancient heresies, they became faithful
followers of the cross." How many hundred days
of purgatory punishment were cancelled for this
pious utterance of the Castilian, History again neglected
to record.</p>

<p>Another ship load was cast out by a barbarous
captain upon the African coast, where the
African savages pounced down upon them, and
abandoned themselves to frightful cruelties. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
men and youths they sold into slavery, the defenseless
women were brutally ravished; the
children at their mothers' breasts, the aged and
the sick and the infirm were mutilated and tortured
and murdered by the thousands.</p>

<p>Another ship load landed in the harbor of
Genoa. A graphic picture of their sufferings is
given by a Genoese historian, an eye witness of
the scenes, which he describes as follows:</p>

<p>"No one," says he, "could behold the sufferings
of the Jewish exiles unmoved. A great many
perished of hunger, especially those of tender
years. Mothers, with scarcely enough strength
to support themselves, carried their famished infants
in their arms, and died with them. Many
fell victims to the cold, others to intense thirst,
while the unaccustomed distress, incident to a sea
voyage, aggravated their maladies. I will not
enlarge on the cruelty and the avarice which they
frequently experienced from the masters of the
ships which transported them from Spain. Some
were murdered to gratify their cupidity, others
forced to sell their children for the expenses of
the passage. They arrived in Genoa in crowds,
but were not suffered to tarry there long, by reason
of the ancient law, which interdicted the
Jewish traveler from a longer residence than
three days. They were allowed, however, to refit
their vessels and to recruit themselves for
some days from the fatigue of the voyage. One
might have taken them for spectres, so emaciated
were they, so cadaverous in their aspect, and
with eyes so sunken; they differed in nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
from the dead, except in the power of motion,
which, indeed, they scarcely retained. Many
fainted and expired on the mole, which, being
completely surrounded by the sea, was the only
quarter vouchsafed to the wretched emigrants.
The infection, bred by such a swarm of dead and
dying persons, was not at once perceived; but
when winter broke up, ulcers began to make their
appearance, and the malady, which lurked for a
long time in the city, broke out into the plague
in the following year."<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>More fortunate were the exiles that landed
upon the shores of Naples. Its king, <i>Ferdinand I.</i>,
was a prudent sovereign, a distinguished scholar,
and, unlike the other rulers of Europe, he had succeeded
in keeping his power above that of the
Church, and his heart free from the inhumanity and
bigotry of the clergy. He opened his kingdom
to the Jews, made the great Abarbanel, formerly
in the service of Isabella, of Castile, one of his
cabinet officers, and personally defended the Jews
from an attack of the clergy and of the populace,
who held the presence of the Jews accountable for
the plague which was then raging, as elsewhere
in Europe, in Naples.</p>

<p>Equally as fortunate were those who landed
upon the coasts where the Turks held dominion.
Sultan <i>Bajazet</i> received them cheerfully, provided
for them humanely, and directed their
intellect and industry into useful channels. "Do
they call this Ferdinand, of Spain, a prudent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
prince," asks the Sultan, "who can thus impoverish
his own kingdom and enrich ours?"</p>

<p>Nearly 150,000 souls made their way, by land,
to Portugal, whose king, <i>John II.</i>, dispensed with
his scruples of conscience so far as to allow his
greed to triumph over his creed. He granted
them a passage through his dominion on their way
to Africa, and the permission of an eight months'
stay in his realm, in consideration of a tax of eight
dollars a head, which immense sum he levied from
the native Portuguese Jews. Ferdinand and
Isabella threatened, and Torquemada incited the
Portuguese clergy, but <i>John II.</i> had over a million
of dollars to quicken his conscience and to wage
war if necessary, and expecting it, he instantly put
such of the Jewish exiles who were manufacturers
of arms and miners to work. But his clemency was
of short duration. It soon gave away to the most
frightful era of the exiles' sufferings. When the news
reached the homeless exiles of the atrocious crimes
inflicted upon their brethren on their way to the
African coasts, by inhuman captains and heartless
crews, seeing nothing but cruel death before
them, whether going or whether remaining, they
preferred meeting death in Portugal, to exposing
themselves to the inhumanity and beastly lusts and
tortures of barbarous pirate sailors and African
savages, and listlessly awaiting death, and praying
for it, they remained after the time purchased for
their stay had passed away. To their misfortune
the plague broke out in Portugal and raged with
deathly fury. Immediately the church arose, held
the Jews responsible for the visitation of the plague,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and lashed the populace into a relentless fury, because
of the visitation of the plague, and the breach
of contract on the part of the Jews. The king's
creed awoke again simultaneously with the re-awakening
of his greed. He issued an edict which
threw even that of Torquemada into the shade.
All Jewish children below fourteen years of age
were torn from their parents' arms, dragged into
the church, baptized; those under three years of
age were given to Christians, to receive a Christian
education, or in other words to be raised as slaves;
those between three and ten years of age, were put
on board of a ship and conveyed to the newly discovered,
unwholesome island of St. Thomas, called
"<i>Ilhas perdidas</i>," "the isles of perdition," which
was colonized by Portuguese condemned criminals,
to fare there as best they could. Those between
ten and fourteen years were sold as slaves. Then,
indeed, the cup of the their affliction was full to the
brim. It was a stern truth which Lenau uttered,
when he said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Die Kirche weiss die Schmerzen zu verwalten</div>
<div class="line">Das Herz bis in die Wurzel aufzuspalten."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Jews have experienced fully the unequaled
skill of the Church in administering pain. Mothers
cast themselves at the feet of the tyrants and
pitifully begged to be taken with their babes;
they were heartlessly thrust aside. Hundreds of
mothers mad with despair, ran behind the ships
as they carried off the idols of their heart, and
perished in the waves. The serene fortitude,
with which the exile people had borne so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and such grievous calamities, gave way at last, and
was replaced by the wildest paroxysms of despair.
Piercing shrieks of anguish filled the land. Childless
and broken-hearted they now sought to leave
the land, but they were told that they had forfeited
their right, and they were given the choice
between baptism and slavery. Thousands, after
enduring all they did, after leaving their beloved
Spain and all their wealth and ease, submitted to
baptism now, in the hope of being reunited with
their children. Thousands were sold as slaves,
yet prior to their being sold, they were submitted
to tortures, cruelties, outrages too revolting, too
repulsive, too heart-rending to be here narrated.</p>

<p>Terror seized upon the native Portuguese Jews,
when they helplessly beheld the cruelties to which
their Spanish brethren were subjected. They
knew they, themselves, could not escape the
wrath of the Church much longer, and they
thought of flight, and well had it been for them
had they made their escape then. While they
were making secret preparations, John II. died,
1495. He had been afflicted, on the very day
when the ships, laden with the Jewish exile children,
set sail for the isle of the condemned criminals,
with a strange, painful malady, and had
lingered ever since.</p>

<p>His own promising son and successor preceded
him into the grave. His cousin <i>Manoel</i> ascended
the throne. He was the counterpart of his predecessor,
kind hearted, a promoter of learning,
eager to further the interests of his country by
discoveries abroad and by commerce at home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Immediately he disfranchised the Jewish exiles
sold into slavery, promised to recall the condemned
children, and issued an edict, in which he commanded
kind treatment to the Jews, and prohibited
accusations against them. In their great joy the
native Portuguese Jews sent an embassy to him,
offering him large sums of money, voluntarily as
a token of their gratitude. The king thanked
them, reassured them of his good will, but refused
to be paid for human kindness.</p>

<p>But, again had destiny decreed that a woman
was to play an ignoble part in the tragic history
of the Jews. A marriage was proposed between
Manoel of Portugal, and the daughter of Ferdinand
and Isabella, of Spain. Manoel was rejoiced with
the proposal. Already he saw himself in the near
future King of United Spain and Portugal, and
of the entire New World. But Satan stepped
between, dipped his pen in gall, and writing the
marriage contract, demanded as one of the conditions,
the immediate expulsion from Portugal of
all the Jews, both natives and exiles.</p>

<p>The king hesitated. The fanatical daughter of
fanatical parents persisted, argument made her
more vehement. Torquemada might well be
proud of his pupil&mdash;the possession of vast empires,
and of the most powerful crown of Europe tempted,
and the tempter conquered. He had purchased
his right to the princess of Spain at a sacrifice of
thousands and thousands of lives, and with the
destruction of the very pillars of his nation's prosperity.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November, 1497, the marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
contract was signed, and on the 20th of the following
month appeared the edict of the expulsion
of the Jews from Portugal.&mdash;The scenes of mourning
and wailing and heart-rending cries which resounded
in Spain, re-echoed in Portugal, only the
more painfully, because of the terrible knowledge
they had since acquired of the meaning of the
word "Expulsion."</p>

<p>Manoel soon regretted his signing away his
most industrious, most intelligent and most prosperous
citizens. But the marriage contract held
him fast, and the Spanish queen kept a watchful
eye on him, and Torquemada upon both. The
prospective vast empire, and the Spanish crown
still dazzled his eyes. He planned a strategy. He
thought he could force the parents to embrace
Christianity, and to remain, if he once succeeded
in getting all their children into his power, and
into the Christian faith. He gave secret orders
for the repetition of the atrocious crime of having
all children under fourteen years of age seized
from their mothers' bosom and fathers' arm, dispersed
through the kingdom to be baptised and
brought up as Christians. The secret became
known. Portugal again re-echoed the wails of
stricken ones. Frantic mothers threw their children
into deep wells or rivers. Mothers were
known to take their babes from their breast and
tear them limb from limb, rather than to resign
them to Christians. They would rather know the
bodies of their children in the grave, and their released
spirit in Heaven, than have them adopt a
faith into which Satan sent his friends for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
schooling. With all the parents' opposition the
king's order was executed. Many accepted baptism,
but not enough to please the king, and to
wreak vengeance upon them for thwarting his
wishes, he revoked his edict, seized all who had
not yet fled and sold them as slaves.</p>

<p>But Israel was not yet forsaken. Italy, which
had now become the seat of European learning,
and had become very prosperous through the commercial
and industrial zeal of the Spanish Jews, to
whom it had offered refuge, and also Turkey, bade
the Portuguese fugitives a hearty welcome. What
Spain and Portugal rejected, they knew how to
value. Even some of the Popes, Clement VII
and Paul III. (I rejoice to give them credit for it),
favored their stay in Italy. They had learned to
appreciate the services of the Jews. The flourishing
Italian and Turkish Jewish congregations ransomed
their brethren, and enabled them to settle
in Ancona, Pesaro, Livorno, Naples, Venice,
Ferrara and elsewhere, and the blessing of God
rested upon whatever city the Jews were permitted
to settle.</p>

<p>Many of the Portuguese Jews settled, and
became prosperous, in the Indies, in Southern
France and in Hamburg. Others settled in
the Netherlands, and became especially prosperous
in Holland. From Holland large numbers
of the descendants of the Portuguese and
Spanish exiles entered England, through the intercession
of <i>Menasse ben Israel</i> with Oliver
Cromwell, and from England and from the Indies
and from Italy they entered the United States,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
into the land where tyranny is known no more,
and persecution is fettered fast. Here dwell
Christian and Jew side by side, peacefully, lovingly,
aiding each other, uniting with each other in the
blessed work for which religion exists on earth,
and in the spreading of the great principles of political
and religious liberty. Here, where Christian
extends the hand of fellowship unto Jew, and the
heart of the Jew beats as loyally American as
that of the Christian, solemnly they pledge:</p>

<p class="p2">A few words more and our task is ended. A
few words more and we shall bid a last farewell
to unfortunate Spain, once so sunny, so prosperous,
so intellectual, and so fair. A few words more
and our goodly vessel, staunch and strong, will
furl its eager wings and speed us straight across
the foaming deep, and land us once again upon
Columbia's heaven blessed and freedom-kissed
virgin soil. As we predicted, so it came to pass.
Our journey back into the centuries of the past,
and into foreign lands, and among foreign peoples,
has proven a profitable one, and as memorable
as profitable. Events and scenes, beautiful
and loathsome, joyous and tearful, soul refreshing
and execrable, followed each other in rapid
succession. There was much, which, despite the
most authentic historic sources, seemed fabulous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
incredible, impossible. Men and women and the
states of society and civilization in which they
lived and played their parts, were described,
which startled us for their peerless magnificence,
for their marvelous intellectuality, scarce equalled
even now, and led us to suppose that we were not
dealing with facts, but with the imagination of some
rich phantasy. And events and achievements were
recounted which struck terror into our very soul,
and caused the heart to rise in rebellion against
the mind when it was asked to believe them as
actual occurrences, and not as some distressing and
revolting and blood-stained work of fiction. And
yet all that was told, and all that was described,
and all that was recounted was history, and true
history, strange and incredible, marvelous and
anomalous though it did appear.</p>

<p>Two races of men engaged our attention most,
the Jews and the Moors. When first we met
the Jews in the southwestern corner of Europe, we
found them a prosperous community, large in
numbers, loved and appreciated by their heathen
neighbors, busily engaged in transforming Spain into
a granery and into the garden spot of Europe,
and contributing largely, by their high morality and
intelligence, by their skill and industry to the nation's
prosperity.</p>

<p>With the advent of the power of Christianity in
Spain, in the Sixth Century, a sad change took
place. It marked the beginning of the martyrology
of the Jews in Europe. Thousands were massacred,
thousands were dragged to the baptismal
font, thousands were forced to take the staff of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
exile. But not for long. A deliverer arose from
the Arabian peninsula and hastened to their
rescue. This Arabian people, agile in the use
of arms, dexterous in the training of horses, capable
of sustaining great fatigue and hardship, and,
true to the Semitic race, intellectual and sagacious,
had lived till late in the Sixth Century a
peaceful, nomadic life. Suddenly they were
awakened out of their religious and political inactivity
by their great leader Mohammed, the prophet.
He kindled in their hearts the fire of
enthusiasm, and led them forth to establish throughout
the world his faith and his dominion. Asia
submitted, Africa submitted. The early dawn of
the Eighth Century saw them, where the African
continent protrudes boldly to meet the continent
of Europe, casting wistful glances across the
straits of Hercules, upon Andalusia's beauteous
lands. The exiled Jews and Christians, roused to
rebellion by the religious and political tyranny of
Spain, conspired with the Mohammedan invaders,
and the portals of Spain were opened to the people
of Arabia, and Europe to the creed of
Mohammed. The exiled Jews returned to their
country, and the baptized to their cherished faith,
for the Arab-Moors tolerated both the Hebrew
people and their faith. Moorish and Jewish skill
and industry and intelligence united, and united
they became&mdash;and they maintained that distinction
for many centuries&mdash;the most prosperous and most
intellectual people of Europe, at a time when the
rest of Europe was numbed into a death-like torpor,
mentally spell-bound, industrially entranced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
politically enslaved, morally degraded and religiously
fettered, by a corrupt priestcraft, to ignorance
and superstition.</p>

<p>Eight centuries long Jew and Moor toiled side
by side, and during all these centuries, the Jews,
with some few exceptions, politically tolerated,
and religiously free, arose to great wealth and
commercial importance, clothed honorably high
political offices, and occupied a social and intellectual
position never equalled in Europe before
or since.</p>

<p>But the Mohammedan power began to wane, and
with its waning came the terrible change in the
fortunes of the Hebrew people. With Moorish
decline awakened the eagerness of the Spaniards
for the provinces from which the Arabian invaders
had driven them, and with it grew a most fanatical
zeal for the expulsion from its territories of
every belief save that of Christianity.</p>

<p>A desperate struggle ensued. Province after
province the Moor was forced to yield to the relentless
foe. At last all was lost. The Mohammedan
power in Spain was crushed. The Moors and
Jews were given the choice between baptism and
expulsion. Hundreds of thousands of them
feigned allegiance to the Church of Christ, and
remained. Hundreds of thousands of them, true
to their faith, parted heart-broken from the land
that was dearer to them than their own life. The
remaining baptized Jews and Moors were soon
suspected of relapsing into their old faith, and the
Inquisition was brought and burned them by the
thousands, and thinned the ranks of the exile Jews.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
By far the greater number perished from cruelty,
exposure, starvation, disease, in their search for a
quiet spot where they might live or die in peace.
Wherever the remainder of them was permitted to
settle, thither they brought blessings<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> verifying
the promise of God: "They that bless thee will be
blest.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>And so, too, was verified the other half of that
promise: "They that curse thee will be cursed."
The curse of God has hung heavily upon Spain,
ever since she had dared to lay violent hand upon
God's anointed, ever since she cruelly massacred,
burned and exiled the most thrifty, the most
industrious, the most intellectual people that ever
trod her soil, and made her the glory of Europe
and the pride of the world. For a short time only,
lingered her prosperity after the expulsion of the
people that had created that prosperity. The
New World, the discovery of which the Jews and
Moors had made possible, poured into the mother
country a prodigious wealth, which hastened
the ruin of Spain. It intoxicated the Spaniards,
and when the sobering came, the effect was terrible.
Had they had the skillful, and industrious
and intelligent Jews and Moors to turn the vast
treasures, which poured into Spain with every
vessel, into useful channels, Spain would
have maintained her position as leader in the
commercial world, and Italy, and France, and the
Netherlands, the new homes of the Jews, would
never have seized it from her, and Spain would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
not have been to-day what she is. But, instead,
it flowed into the coffers of the greedy and insatiable
Church, and the richer the Church became
the more terrible became its tyranny, and
the greater the inducement for laymen to enter
it. Convents and Churches multiplied with such
vast speed, that early in the Seventeenth Century
the Spanish historian enumerates upwards of
9,000 monasteries, besides nunneries, 32,000
Dominican and Franciscan friars, 14,000 chaplains
in the diocese of Seville, and 18,000 in the diocese
of Calahorra.</p>

<p>The State was completely in its power. Even
Charles V and Phillip II, sovereigns not to be
matched in any other country for a period of equal
length, submitted cheerfully to the power of the
Church, and thought it a blessed privilege to do
so. It was Charles V's great boast that he always
preferred his creed to his country, and proved
his boast by slaying in cold blood, in the Netherlands,
over 50,000 peaceful, industrious, good
Christian citizens for their religious opinions. The
cannibal appetite of the Church had to be appeased,
when the stock of Jewish and Moorish victims
was exhausted, truth and knowledge-seeking
Christians had to supply their places upon the
<i>quemaderos</i>, and in the torture-dungeons of the
Inquisition. Even with his last breath he commanded
his son, Philip, never to show favor to
heretics, to kill them all, to uphold the Inquisition
as the best means for the establishment of the
true belief. Philip II. proved himself worthy of
his sire. He has written his services to the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
upon history's records with flames of fire and letters
of blood.</p>

<p>With amazing swiftness Spain's once invincible
power began to disappear, becoming weaker with
every century, and to-day the population of more
than 30,000,000 of people before the expulsion of
the Jews and Moors has dwindled down to about
one half of that number, while her neighboring
countries have increased in numbers and prosperity.
"So rapid was the fall of Spain," says Buckle
in his "History of the Civilization of England,"
Vol. II, Chap. I, "that the most powerful monarchy
existing in the world was depressed to the
lowest point of debasement, was insulted with
impunity by foreign nations, was reduced more
than once to bankruptcy, was stripped of her fairest
possessions, was held up to public opprobrium,
was made a theme on which schoolboys and moralists
loved to declaim, respecting the uncertainty
of human affairs. Truly did she drink to
the dregs the cup of her own shame. Her glory
had departed from her, she was smitten down and
humbled. The mistress of the world was gone;
her power was gone, no more to return."</p>

<p>The Church had proven itself a false prophet.
"Once purge blessed Spain," it preached to its
credulous followers, "of the presence of the accursed
Jews and Moors, and yourselves and your
families will be under the immediate protection
of Heaven. The earth will bear more fruit. A
new era will be inaugurated, Spain will be at ease.
People will live in safety, and gather in peace and
in abundance the fruits of their handiwork."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the prophecy: but bitter its fulfilment.
With the expulsion of the Jews and Moors large
bodies of industrious and expert agriculturists and
skilled mechanics were suddenly withdrawn, and
there was no one to fill their place. The
cultivation of rice, cotton and sugar, and the manufacture
of silk and paper was destroyed at a blow,
and most of it was destroyed forever, for the
Spanish Christians, still intoxicated with their
military and financial and social greatness, considered
such pursuits beneath their dignity. To
fight for the king and to enter the Church was
honorable, but everything else was mean and
sordid. Whole districts were deserted and have
never been repeopled to the present day. The
brigands soon occupied the places formerly so
beneficially filled by honest toilers. In less than
fifty years 16,000 looms of Seville, giving employment
to 130,000 persons, had dwindled away
to less than 300, and its population to one quarter
of its former number. The mines stood idle until
foreigners took pity of some of them. The others
are idle still. A little over one hundred years ago
the Spanish government being determined to have
a navy, found it necessary to send to England
for shipwrights; and they were obliged to apply
to the same quarter for persons who could make
ropes and canvas, the skill of the natives being
unequal to such arduous achievements; and early
in the eighteenth century they were obliged to
import laborers from Holland to teach the Spaniards
the art of making wool, an art for which in
their glorious past they were especially famous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The consequences of this industrial and agricultural
standstill could not fail. Famine set in.
The grandees murmured aloud against the State
for expelling the Jews and Moors. The citizens
of Madrid fell down in the streets famished and
perished where they fell&mdash;so had famished and
died the Jewish exiles&mdash;anarchy prevailed.
Peaceful citizens organized themselves into bands
and going in search of bread, broke open private
houses, and robbed and murdered the inhabitants
in the face of day&mdash;thus had been murdered the
Jewish exiles. Verily God's prophecy was fulfilled:
"And I will bless them that bless thee, and
curse them that curse thee, in thee shall the families
of the earth be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Spain's intellectual decline kept steady pace with
its political and industrial decay. No more is she
the center of Europe's learning. No more does her
intellect shed luminous rays all over the world.
The Moor and the Jew have fled her provinces,
and darkness covers her lands, the shadows of
night again brood stiflingly over her people.
Her poverty has made her ignorant, her ignorance
has made her intensely fanatic, and her
fanaticism is, to this day, the enemy of all social
and intellectual advance. For two centuries and
more investigation likely to stimulate thought
was positively prohibited. In the measure that
her sister countries advanced intellectually she
declined, and in proportion as they shook off the
fetters of the Church, she cheerfully submitted to
have them drawn tighter about her. Until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
eighteenth century Madrid did not possess a
single public library, and to-day the number of
volumes in all the Spanish libraries cannot reach
500,000. The library of Cordova in the tenth
century, before the printing press was discovered,
counted over 600,000 volumes. The Government
library of Paris and that of London count respectively
over 1,500,000 and over 2,000,000 volumes.
So late as the year 1771 the University of Salamanca,
the most ancient and most famous seat of
learning in Spain, publicly refused to allow the
discoveries of Newton to be taught, and assigned
as a reason that his system was not consonant
with revealed religion. Buckle quotes from
Spanish sources, an epistle which will illustrate
the abysses of ignorance into which the Spanish
intellect had sunk. About a century ago some
bold men proposed that the streets of Madrid
should be cleansed. The proposal was met with
excited indignation. The question was submitted
by the government to the medical profession.
They reported unfavorably. They had no doubt
that the dirt ought to remain. To remove it
was a new experiment, and of new experiments
it was impossible to foresee the issue. Their
fathers having lived in it, why should they not do
the same? Their fathers were wise men, and
must have had good reasons for their conduct.
The filth shall remain. And it did remain. And
it did make Spain the, alas, too frequent victim
of plague and cholera, and we now no longer
wonder that a year ago, when the cholera raged
in Spain, the people arose against the physicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
for being asked to resort to medicines and cleanliness
and not to Relics and Holy Water.</p>

<p>Intellectually Spain sleeps on, dreams on, receiving
no impressions from the rest of the
world and making none upon it. "There she
lies," says the historian, "at the further extremity
of the continent, a huge and torpid mass, the sole
representation now remaining of the feelings and
knowledge of the middle ages. And what is the
worst symptom of all, she is satisfied with her
own condition. Though she is the most backward
country in Europe, she believes herself foremost.
She is proud of everything of which she
should be ashamed. She is proud of the antiquity
of her opinions; proud of her orthodoxy; proud of
the strength of her faith; proud of her immeasurable
and childish credulity; proud of her unwillingness
to amend either her creed or her customs;
proud of her hatred of heretics, and proud of the
undying vigilance with which she has baffled their
efforts to obtain a full and legal establishment
on her soil."</p>

<p>But since Buckle penned these forcible lines,
she has made a change. She has recalled the
Jews, some five years ago, after 400 years
of banishment. Her eyes have been opened at
last, and she now seeks to repair her wrongs to
the people she afflicted most. And prosperity
will follow the re-entrance of the Jews. Spain
will again be blest; it may take time, church
tyranny will first have to be crushed and ignorance
and superstition rooted out, but crushed and rooted
out they will be. Her harbors on the Atlantic
and Mediterranean will again command the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>merce
of both hemispheres. Her cities will
again teem with people. Her towns will
again flourish, her manufactures will again be
skillful, the produce of her exuberant soil will
again gladden the heart of mankind. Her inexhaustible
mines, rich in all the precious and all
the useful metals, her quarries of marbles and her
beds of coal will again set the wheel of industry
into busy motion. She will be blest again. She
must be blest again, for such is the word of God.
She has held out the hand of friendship to His
anointed people, and they that bless them will be
blest.</p>

<p>The Moors, Spain no more can recall. The
Arab-Moors, such as they were in Spain, exist no
longer. Their descendants roam as benighted
Bedouins over those regions of Africa which their
ancestors once illumined by the light of learning.
Gone is most of their literature. The beautiful
accents of the classic Arabic tongue are heard
no more. Darkness, deep darkness, rules
over the Arabian peninsula now. The history
that their sires in Spain have made our civilization
their debtor, reads indeed, to-day, like unto
a fairy tale.</p>

<p>But the Jews live, and fulfill the glorious mission
for which they have been scattered throughout
the world. The people chosen by the Eternal
Jehovah to be His priest people cannot die. The
people that has seen the tidal waves of Babylon,
Persia, Greece, Egypt, Rome roll over it and instead
of engulfing it has lived to see them engulfed;
the people that live after a thousand strug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>gles,
after deeds of heroic courage that Rome,
and Athens, and Sparta, and Carthage have never
equaled, outliving them all; the people that still
lives, after eighteen centuries of persecution, and
still is united, though scattered the wide world
over, and though not held together by the ties of
any fatherland, was never destined to be annihilated
by any Church or by any race of men.
The Jew is older than both, and will outlive
them both. Time and death wield no power
over him. Emerson spoke truly:</p>

But no sooner had their Arian masters embraced the orthodox faith,
than they began to testify their zeal by pouring on the Jews the most
pitiless storm of persecution. One of their laws alone condemned the

Inquisition, the monks of the fifteenth century only copying, in reference

flatter ourselves have originated in our own times. Thus our modern
doctrines of evolution and development were taught in their schools. In
fact, they carried them much farther than we are disposed to do, extending
them even to inorganic and mineral things. The fundamental
principle of alchemy was the natural process of development of metalline
bodies. "When common people," says Al-Khazini, writing in the
twelfth century, "hear from natural philosophers that gold is a body
which has attained to perfection of maturity, to the goal of completeness,
they firmly believe that it is something which has gradually come
to that perfection by passing through the forms of all other metallic
bodies, so that its gold nature was originally lead, afterward it became
tin, then brass, then silver, and finally reached the development of gold;
not knowing that the natural philosophers mean, in saying this, only
something like what they mean when they speak of man, and attribute
to him a completeness and equilibrium in nature and constitution&mdash;not
that man was once a bull, and was changed into an ass, and afterward
into a horse, and after that into an ape, and finally became a man."</p>

<p>The Jews were the most skillful physicians, the ablest financiers, and
among the most profound philosophers; while they were only second to
the Moors in the cultivation of natural science. They were also the chief
interpreters to western Europe of Arabian learning. But their most important
service, and that with which we are now most especially concerned,
was in sustaining commercial activity. For centuries they were its
only representatives. By travelling from land to land till they became intimately
acquainted both with the wants and the productions of each, by
practising money-lending on a large scale and with consumate skill, by keeping
up a constant and secret correspondence and organising a system of exchange
that was then unparalleled in Europe, the Jews succeeded in making
themselves absolutely indispensable to the Christian community, and
in accumulating immense wealth and acquiring immense influence in
the midst of their sufferings. When the Italian republics rose to power,
they soon became the centres to which the Jews flocked; and under the
merchant governments of Leghorn, Venice, Pisa, and Genoa, a degree of
toleration was accorded that was indeed far from perfect, but was at last
immeasurably greater than elsewhere. (From Lecky's "Rationalism in
Europe," part II, Chapter VI.).</p>

<p>From the port of Barcelona the Spanish khalifs had carried on an
enormous commerce, and they with their coadjutors&mdash;Jewish merchants&mdash;had
adopted or originated many commercial inventions, which, with
matters of pure science, they had transmitted to the trading communities
of Europe. The art of book-keeping by double entry was thus brought into
Upper Italy. The different kinds of insurance were adopted, though strenuously
resisted by the clergy. They opposed fire and marine insurance, on
the ground that it was a tempting of Providence. Life insurance was
regarded as an act of interference with the consequences of God's will.
Houses for lending money on interest, that is, banking establishments,
were bitterly denounced, and especially was indignation excited against
the taking of high rates of interests, which was stigmatized as usury&mdash;a
feeling existing in some backward communities up to the present day. Bills
of exchange in the present form were adopted, the office of the public notary
established, and protests for dishonored obligations resorted to. Indeed,
it may be said, with but little exaggeration, that the commercial
machinery now used was thus introduced. (Draper's "Conflict between
Religion and Science," Chapter XI, pg. 317-318)</p>

<p>"The isolation in which the Jews were forced to live, and the prohibitions
long continued, against acquiring real estate, directed their speculations
toward commerce and manufactures, in which they soon obtained incontestable
superiority.... Nothing is more curious to study than the commercial
condition of that nation which had no territory of its own, nor
ports, nor armies, and which, constantly tacking about on an agitated
sea, with contrary winds, at last arrived in port with rich cargoes and
immense wealth. The Jews traded because it was rarely permitted them to
employ themselves in any other way with security. While the multiplicity
of toll-houses and the tyranny of the feudal lords rendered all trade impossible
except that of the petty tradesmen of the market-towns and
cities, the Jews, more bold, more mobile, were dreaming of vaster operations,
and were working silently to bind together continents, to bring
together kingdoms. They avoided the highways and the castles, carefully
concealing their real opulence and their secret transactions under
the appearances of poverty. They went great distances for rare products
of the remote countries, and brought them within reach of well-to-do
consumers. By wandering about and traveling from country to country
they had acquired an exact acquaintance with the needs of all places;
they knew where to buy and where to sell. Some samples and a notebook
sufficed them for their most important operations. They corresponded
with each other on the strength of engagements which their
interest obliged them to respect, in view of the enemies of every sort by
whom they were surrounded. Commerce has lost the trace of the ingenious
inventions which were the result of their efforts; but it is to their
influence that it owes the rapid progress of which history shows us the
brilliant phenomenon in the midst of the horrors of feudal darkness.
Insensibly, the Jews were absorbing all the money, since this was the
kind of property which they could acquire and keep safely.... For
more than five hundred years, it is in the history of that nation that we
must study the progress of commerce and the more or less venturesome
attempts through which it has risen to the rank of political power....
The Jews were the depositaries of the finest cloths known, and they traded
in them at immense profits: they extended the use and at the same time
the demand for them into castles and into abbeys. They also engrossed
the trade in jewelry and in gold and silver bullion. Feudalism disturbed
these lucrative occupations less than one might suppose: the lords put
upon them strict conditions, but they had the good sense to treat them
with respect. Besides in the midst of the general terror which continually
hovered around all highways and all travelers, the Jews, armed with
safe-conducts, traveled all over Europe without inquietude, and in the
tenth and eleventh centuries disposed like sovereigns of all the commerce
of France. At that period, they had already greatly simplified
commercial proceedings, and their correspondence would have done honor
to the most able merchants of our great cities.</p>

<p>The appearance of the tradesmen of Lombardy, Tuscany, and other
parts of Italy completed the work of the Jews and gave an energetic impulse
to the commerce of the middle ages. The latter, from that time,
traded in everything, and put in circulation real and personal property,
such as horses, lands and houses. The historian Rigord goes so far as
to say that the Jews were, at that time, real proprietors of half the kingdom....
It is also claimed that it was at this time that the first Bills
of Exchange appeared, the invention of which some trace to about the
seventh century, and others, only to the middle of the twelfth. It is a
point which has not yet been cleared up, and which is not of so much
consequence as some have supposed. The date of such a discovery,
even if it could be authentically fixed, would be of interest simply as a
matter of curiosity; but it appears destined to remain forever in doubt.
It is thought, and with reason, that the invention is rather due to the
Italian traders than to the Jewish brokers of this time, the latter not having
had occasion as soon as the others to devote themselves to trade between
different places, which probably suggested the idea. The very
name of Letter of Exchange, which was primitively Italian, seems to indicate
their true authorship; and the first city where they were used, Lyons,
then the entrepot of Italy, is a further indication. It is probable that the
Lombards and the Jews had an equal part in inventing them, and divined,
from the beginning, the important consequences from their use.<a name="FNanchor_36a" id="FNanchor_36a" href="#Footnote_36a" class="fnanchor">[36a]</a>
These ingenious contrivers later entered into a strife, and the history of
the Italian republics of the middle ages is full of the debates which arose
between them on the subject of privileges which some wished to exercise to
the exclusion of others. We see the Jews become intendants, stewards,
procurators, bankers, and even agents in marriages, according as they are
more or less forcibly driven from all the regular commercial positions by
the bulls of the Popes or by the jealousy of competitors. Everything
thus contributed to narrow them down to a vicious circle, from which
they can only escape by usury and money negotiations. When envy
has forced them to abandon a city, the interest of the inhabitants calls
them back; their capital has become so necessary to their industrial cities
that the orders of the authorities are disregarded to prevent the Jews
carrying it elsewhere. Moreover, soon houses for loaning money are
started even in the villages; and the Jews of Tuscany direct from a central
point a multitude of branch-houses of their establishments at Florence
and Pisa. Their opulence and their magnificence surpassed imagination,
and aroused against them fanatical adversaries. We know the
history of that famous Bernardin de Feltre, who carried his enthusiasm
so far as to preach a crusade against them, and who on every occasion
showed himself their most implacable enemy. He pursued them everywhere
as usurers thirsting for the blood of the people, and, to ruin their
establishments, he conceived the idea of opposing them by the formation
of those houses of loaning on pledges, which are called <i>monts-de-piete.</i>
At the beginning, everything was free in them, and the sums lent were
without interest. Moreover, their success was prodigious, and most of the
cities of Italy had their <i>monts-de-piete</i>, which were one day to surpass in
usurious exactions the boldest operations of the Jews.... However
these <i>monts-de-piete</i> could not fill the place of the establishments of the
Jews, and this circumstance proves with what shrewdness the latter had
truly divined the wants of the money circulation. Although <i>monts-de-piete</i>
loaned money almost without interest, the formalities which it was
necessary to undergo in order to have a right to their help, the inevitable
delays in their administration, the necessity of proving the legitimate
possession of the articles pledged, and above all, the obligation on the
part of depositors to make known their names, soon kept away borrowers,
who could obtain funds at any time, in secret and without formalities,
from the Jewish bankers. Rich and poor, lords and villeins, hastened
to them, and their credit was so great at Leghorn, in the times of
the Medicis, that the saying became proverbial: "<i>It is better to beat the
Grand-duke than a Jew</i>." Pope Sixtus Fifth had opened again to them
all the sources of wealth which his predecessors had closed; their goods
were even exempt from every toll, the <i>sacra monte della pieta</i> ceased to
compete with them, when the Christians in charge had surpassed the
abuses of their rivals. After ten years of its existence, the <i>monts-de-piete</i>
had become what they are to-day, open pits under the steps of misfortune
rather than asylums to escape it.... Everything then seems
to warrant the belief that the Jews exercise a notable influence on the
course of political economy in Europe, by keeping in charge, in the
midst of feudal anarchy, the commercial traditions destined to become
perfected and refined in the atmosphere of the fifteenth century. It is to
the persecutions of which they were victims that we are indebted for the
first attempts at credit and the system of circulation. They alone, perhaps,
by concentrating on trade in gold and silver an attention which
the prejudices of their contemporaries prevented them from giving to
anything else, prepared the way for the great monetary revolution which
the discovery of the mines in America and the establishment of European
banks were to accomplish in the world. Thus the luminous trace of the
future shines and is preserved, in the midst even of the darkest events.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_39" id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> There is a Roman Catholic periodical entitled <i>La Bandera Catholica</i>
(The Catholic Banner) which is published in Barcelona, Spain; and on
July 29th, 1883, it published an article which caused one almost to think
he was living in the sixteenth instead of the nineteenth century.
The writer of the article imagines the burning stake is a thing of the
near future. He says, "Thank God, at last we have turned toward the times
when heretical doctrines were persecuted as they should be, and when
those who propagated them were punished with exemplary punishment.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Holy Tribunal of the Inquisition must
soon take place. Its reign will be more glorious and fruitful in results
than in the past, and the number of those who will be called to suffer
under it will exceed the number of the past. Our Catholic heart overflows
with faith and enthusiasm, and the immense joy which we experience
as we begin to reap the fruit of our present campaign exceeds all imagination.
What a day of pleasure will that be for us when we see the
masons, spiritualists, free thinkers and anti-clericals writhe in the
flames, of the Inquisition!"</p>

<p>We also read in another article of the same Roman Catholic paper
that during the time of the existence of the Inquisition, from 1481 to 1808
in Spain alone there were 35,534 men and women burnt alive, and,
93,533 condemned to other punishments, because they differed in
opinion from the Romish Church.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
